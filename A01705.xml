            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

There is a worthy example in the life of <hi>Hilde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brand</hi> the Pope, ſet out by Cardinall <hi>Benno,</hi> I haue read it in ſundry Authors of good credit, and it is recorded in the booke of Martires. The Emperour was wont often to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paire to prayer to the Church of S. <hi>Marie,</hi> which is in the Mount <hi>Auentine:</hi> but this <hi>Hildebrand,</hi> whenas by his ſpies he had made diligent inquiry after all his workes, hee made the place be marked where the Emperour was woont to pray, and perſwaded one by promiſing him money, to laie great ſtones vpon the beames of the Church ſecretly, and that he ſhould ſo order them, that he might throwe them downe from aboue vpon the Emperours head as he was at prayer, and ſo beate out his braines. Which thing when he was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poynted
<pb facs="tcp:15371:4"/>
to doe, he made haſte to accompliſh ſo great wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and ſought to lay a huge ſtone vpon the beames: with the weight thereof, the ſtone drewe him downe, and the boardes being broken vnder the beames, both the ſtone, and the miſerable man, by the iuſt iudgement of God, fell downe into the Church floore, and by the ſaid ſtone hee was quite cruſhed in peeces. Of the which fact after the men of <hi>Rome</hi> knew, and of the order thereof, they tied a rope to the wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches foote, and cauſed him to be drawne three daies through the ſtreetes, for the example of others. See the Popes trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery and impiety, reſpecting no perſon, time, nor place, and the iuſt iudgement of God vpon the malefactor.</p>

Of all this, we our ſelues, and this whole land haue had experience often heretofore, and now of late moſt of all. In that miſchieuous and bloudie plot, intended and prepared againſt vs, by our aduerſaries the Papiſts, pittes they haue deepely, and cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ningly digged, ſubtill ſnares, and traines they haue layed, but to their owne ſhame and confuſion: the goodnes of God hath turned their miſchiefe vpon their owne heads, theſe things are new and freſh in memorie, and we cannot but ſtil daylie ſpeake and thinke ſeriouſlie of them, and I doubt not buy your Honor hath in priuate, and that in good earneſt thought vpon them, and I am ſure, that in that famous City, ſo well gouerned and taught, many worthy ſermons haue bin publikely preached, ſhewing in farre more excellent manner then I can, the greatnes of our daungers, the greatnes of our deliuerance, and the right vſe of the ſame.

            <p>The reaſons mouing me to dedicate this my poore labour to your Honor, are theſe. Firſt, becauſe you are the chiefe in this countrie, both in power, and profeſſeſsion of the Goſpell: and therefore no doubt, will endeauour to the vttermoſt, to defend the truth, and ſuppreſſe the enemies of the ſame. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, to teſtifie my good will and thankfulneſſe, for all your great and manifod fauours, and kindnes to mee and mine, which I am vnable any way to requite. For the which, I pray with the Apoſtle, The Lord graunt vnto your Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, that you may finde mercy with the Lord at that day: and I ſay to you ſeuerally, <hi>Diligat te Deus, quia Dei ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uos diligis:</hi> The Lord loue thee, becauſe thou loueſt the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants of God. Thirdly, becauſe the matters heere handled, as they are pleaſing to all Chriſtians and good ſubiects: ſo much more to your Honor, then to many, whoſe danger had beene in ſome reſpect greater, ſo the deliuerance more: and therefore more thankes and dutie required.</p>

But ſome perhaps, may thinke this Treatiſe vnſeaſonable, comming forth ſo long after our Deliuerance: they will ſay, it is now too ſtale, and forgotten, and many books are extant long ſince of this kind of Argument.

The Writer is <hi>Dauid,</hi> a King, a Prophet, a man according to Gods owne heart. The ſweete Singer of <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael,</hi> extraordinarily qualified, with eſpeciall graces of the holy ghoſt. The matter is excellent, and pertinent, a Pſalme
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:15371:7"/>
gratulatory, of ioy and thankeſgiuing for ſome great deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerance from his enemies; ſo that hee writeth and ſpeaketh in this Pſalme by his owne feeling and experience: he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe was in great diſtreſſe, both in body and minde: his caſe ſeemed deſolate and deſperate, yet calling vpon God, hee was heard; and being heard, reioyceth and praiſeth God. He is the beſt teacher that ſpeaketh vpon feeling, and expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience in himſelfe of that which hee teacheth others. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſaieth one, that ſpeech is willingly receiued of the hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, which is vttred by the Preacher with compaſsion of the minde: he knoweth beſt to ſpeake well, who hath learned firſt to doe well; and then doth the ſeede of the word bring foorth fruit when the godlines of the Preacher doth water it in the breaſt of the hearer. Let vs therefore heare this royall and holy teacher, firſt feeling and practiſing in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe that which he teacheth others. This Pſalme conſiſts of two partes: In the firſt is ſet out the great goodneſſe of God to <hi>Dauid,</hi> and his loue and faith to God in the firſt ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen verſes; in the ſecond part, from thence to the end, hee ſetteth downe his proteſtation, profeſsion, purpoſe, vowes, &amp; promiſes of thankefulnes to God for ſo great a goodnes, in deliuering him from ſo great and iminent dangers. The goodnes of god he amplifies, in relating the greatnes of this diſtreſſe, that he was neere to death, and that it ſeemed im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſsible by mans helpe to auoyde the anguiſh that was ſei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed vpon his heart. The greatnes of his diſtreſſe he ſetteth out in many words, that the ſnares of death compaſſed him, the griefes of the graue caught him, that he found griefe and ſorrow, that hee was deliuered from death, his eyes from teares, and his feete from falling; that vppon the feeling of the preſent diſtreſſe, he beganne to be ſomewhat impatient, and to diſtruſt God: his faith to God appeares in his earneſt praiers to God, and in his conqueſt and victory ouer all his temptations.</p>
               <p>The ground of his prayers and victory, is the mercy and truth of God; the Lord (ſaith he) is mercifull and righteous,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:15371:7"/>
and our God is full of compaſsion, the Lord preſerueth the ſimple, and this he applies to himſelfe to be an example to others: I was in miſery ſaith he, and ho ſaued me. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon he reioyceth and triumpheth, ſaying, returne to thy reſt, O my ſoule. His proteſtation and profeſsion of thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnes, he expreſſeth vnder varietie of phraſes and ſeuerall formes of ſpeech, he entreth into diſputation with himſelfe, amplifying the goodneſſe of God, his owne willingneſſe to requite, and yet inſufficiencie to performe in the twelfth verſe of this Pſalme, ſaying, <hi>What ſhall I render to the Lord for all his benefites towards me?</hi> as if he ſhould ſay, I do acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge his wonderfull and great benefites, and I haue ſome care and deſire to ſhew my ſelfe thankefull; but what is in me? or what haue I wherewithal I may requite his kindnes? yet I will doe what I can; I will take the Cup of Saluation: I will pay my vowes, I wil offer the ſacrifice of praiſe pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liquely in his houſe. The ſumme and meaning of all is this, that he will for this great deliuerance, extraordinarily ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully with mouth and heart, and openly, praiſe his God in the publique congregation. And this Pſalme agreeth with many other Pſalmes; the beginning of it agreeth with the beginning of the eighteene Pſalme; the firſt ſixe verſes of that Pſalme; the end of it agreeth with the eight, nine, and tenne verſes of the ſixt Pſalme; and the whole Pſalme a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> with the thirty one Pſalme: and many other Pſalmes there be of the like argument with this: and now let vs firſt obſerue from theſe great dangers and diſtreſſes that <hi>Dauid</hi> was in, that the holieſt men are ſubiect to the greateſt dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers.</p>
               <p>This is ſo plaine, we neede no proofe of it, <hi>Abraham, I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaac,</hi> and <hi>Iacob,</hi> with the reſt of the Patriarkes, the Prophets, Chriſt, and the Apoſtles had ſufficient experience of this. Let vs conſider but one example for all: The Apoſtle ſaint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith thus of himſelfe, 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 23. that he was in la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours aboundant, in ſtripes aboue meaſure, in death oft; that of the Iewes hee receiued fiue times fourty ſtripes ſaue
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:15371:8"/>
one, that he was thriſe beaten with roddes, once ſtoned, that he ſuffered thriſe ſhipwracke, that he was night and day in the deepe ſea, in iourneying often, in perilles of waters, in perilles of robbers, in perilles of his owne nation, in perilles among the Gentiles, in perilles in the cittie, in perilles in the wildernes, in perilles in the ſea, in perilles among falſe bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, in wearineſſe and painfulneſſe, in watching often, in hunger and thirſt, in faſtings often, in colde and nakednes. The manifold and great diſtreſſe which <hi>Dauid</hi> was in, both in body and minde, we may ſee in the ſixt, eighteenth, and one and thirty Pſalmes, before alleadged in this preſent Pſalme, and many more.</p>
               <p>And let vs further note to our comfort, that in the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt calamities, the Lord doth not leaue his, but doth either leſſen their griefe, comfort them inwardly, or quite deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer <note place="margin">Pſal. 9. 9.</note>them. Therefore the Prophet ſaith in another place, <hi>The Lord will be a refuge for the poore, a refuge in due time, euen</hi>

And in another Pſalme hee ſaith, <hi>In the multitude of my thoughts in my heart thy comforts</hi>

Tim. 4. 16.</note>place he ſaith thus, <hi>At my firſt anſwering, no man aſſiſted me, but all forſooke me: I pray God that it may not be laid to their charge. Notwithſtanding the Lord aſſiſted me, and ſtrengthned me, that by me the preaching might be fully knowen, and that all the Gentiles ſhould heare, and I was deliuered out of the mouth of the Lion. And the Lord will deliuer me from euery euill worke, and will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue me vnto his heauenly kingdome.</hi> In this place we haue heard the great dangers that <hi>Dauid</hi> was in, that he was as a bird taken in a ſnare, that his enemies were readie to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe and entrap him, that he was in danger of life; yet he ſaid, the Lord heard his prayers, the Lord was beneficiall vnto him and deliuered him: and he learned this by expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, that the death of Gods Saints are pretious in his ſight, that he doth diſpoſe them, and hath a care of them: And now let vs conſider how <hi>Dauid</hi> behaueth himſelfe in theſe his great dangers; he doth not murmur, nor deſpaire, but calleth vpon God, and truſteth in him: indeede he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth his weakneſſe in the eleauenth verſe, that ſomtimes hee began to doubt of Gods promiſes, as though God had left him, and would not be as good as his word, ſpoken by <hi>Samuel,</hi> in eſtabliſhing him in his kingdome. There are

imperfections in the Saints of God, their knowledge is mixed with ignorance, their patience with ſome impati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, <note place="margin">Iob. 3.</note>their faith with ſome infidelitie. <hi>Iob</hi> a moſt perfect patterne of patience, yet the greatnes and continuance of his temptations cauſed him ſometimes to ſpeake fooliſhly and impatiently. The Apoſtle S <hi>Paul</hi> confeſſeth, that he found in himſelfe the law of the members reſiſting againſt <note place="margin">Rom. 7.</note>the law of the ſpirit: in another place he ſaith, <hi>That the fleſh luſteth againſt the ſpirit, and the ſpirit againſt the fleſh.</hi> But though there be this combat in the Saints of God, yet grace and the ſpirit preuayleth againſt the fleſh. <hi>Iob</hi> in the end confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth <note place="margin">Iob. 39. 37.</note>his follie and impatience, ſaying to God, <hi>Behold, I am vile, what ſhall I anſwere thee? I will lay my hand vpon my mouth: Once haue I ſpoken, but I will anſwere no more, yea twiſe, but I will proceed no farther.</hi> And after he doth abhorre himſelfe for his raſhnes, and doth repent himſelfe in duſt and aſhes. <note place="margin">Iob. 42. 6.</note>And <hi>Dauid</hi> ſaith of himſelfe, <hi>Though I ſaid in my haſte, I am caſt out of thy ſight, yet thou heardeſt the voice of my prayer when</hi>

Let vs learne of him in all troubles and dangers, to flie vnto God by hartie prayer, hee vſeth no doubt all good meanes of ſtrength and policie for his owne ſafety, but yet he contenteth not himſelfe with that, his chiefe refuge is, to call vpon God, as he ſaith in the fourth verſe: <hi>Then I called vpon the name of the Lord, ſaying, I beſeech thee O Lord deliuer my ſoule.</hi> Prayer is the key of heauen. <hi>Oratio aſcendit, gratia deſcendit,</hi> ſaith one, that is, Prayer aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendeth, grace deſcendeth: in ſicknes, in health, in plentie, in penurie, in aduerſitie, and proſperitie; in life, in death, prayer is one ſpeciall comfort, hope, ſtay, refuge, and ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuarie of Gods children, it is their chiefe weapon, armour, triumph, and victorie. <hi>The name of the Lord is a ſtrong tower</hi> faith <hi>Salomon, the righteous runneth vnto it and is exalted.</hi> Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <note place="margin">Prou. 18. 10.

As farre as the Eaſt is from the Weſt, ſo farre hath he remooued our ſinnes from vs. As a Father hath compaſsion vpon his children, ſo hath the Lord com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſsion vpon them that feare him. For he knoweth where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of we be made, he knoweth that we are but duſt.

               <p>This is a ſure pillar &amp; proppe of faith. The Lord is alſo righteous, that is, true and faithfull in his promiſe; he hath promiſed the protection of his children, hee muſt needes performe it, he cannot goe from his word, he cannot lie. It is the Lordes mercie (ſaith <hi>Ieremie)</hi> that wee are not conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, becauſe his compaſsions faile not, they are renewed e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery morning, great is thy faithfulnes. <hi>Dauid</hi> vpon the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance of this trueth and mercy of God, dooth apply and appropriate God to himſelfe: Our God (ſaieth he) is full of compaſsion; accompting God to be his God aſwell as the God of others. That God hath bound himſelfe to him, that he is within his couenant, and vnder his protection: an other ground of his faith ariſing from the mercy and truth of God, that it is the nature and practiſe of God to preſerue the ſimple, that is, ſuch as lie open to the enemies, ſuch as are ſoone deceiued, ſuch as truſt not in themſelues, but in God, and deſire helpe of him. The Lord (ſaith <hi>Dauid)</hi> in an other place, dooth build vp <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> and gather together the diſperſed of <hi>Iſrael;</hi> he healeth all thoſe that are broken in heart, and bindeth vp their ſores: he applieth this to him ſelfe, I was in miſery, ſaith he, and hee ſaued mee. Vpon
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:15371:11"/>
theſe grounds he gathereth this confidence and boldneſſe, and dooth ſtirre vp himſelfe, and triumph, ſaying, Returne to thy reſt, O my ſoule, for the Lord hath been beneficiall vnto thee. I ſhall walke before the Lord in the land of the liuing; that is, I ſhall not die as mine enemies would haue me, but the Lord will preſerue and ſaue my life. And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, he ſayth in this Pſalme, Pretious in the ſight of the Lord is the death of his Saints: that is, I perceiue that God hath a care ouer his, and that the wicked can not take them away at their pleaſure, and that God heereafter will keepe me vnder his gratious protection. Marke the boldeneſſe, confidence and aſſurance of the Prophet; he doth not now doubt nor wauer, his faith preuaileth againſt all: he ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to his owne ſoule, ſaying, Returne to thy reſt, as if hee ſhould ſay, thou haſt beene much diſquieted, thou haſt had great griefe and trouble, but be of good cheere, reſt vpon God, I haue found how ſweet he is to me. And marke how he reaſoneth from the experience of Gods mercy in others, and himſelfe, to aſſure him of his fauor in time to come, and thus he reaſoneth in the 22. Pſalme, verſe 4. Our fathers truſted in thee, they truſted, and thou did deſt deliuer them, they called vpon thee, and were deliuered, they truſted in thee, and were not confounded: thereby he gathereth, that God would heare and helpe him, becauſe he had heard and helped others. And when <hi>Saul</hi> had diſcouraged <hi>Dauid,</hi> 1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 17. ſaying, Thou art not able to goe againſt the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſtine great Goliah to fight with him, for thou arte a boy, and he is a man of warre from his youth. <hi>Dauid</hi> aunſwered vnto <hi>Saul,</hi> Thy ſeruant kept his fathers ſheepe, and there came a Lion, and likewiſe a Beare, and tooke a ſheepe out of the flocke, and I went out after him, and ſmote him, and tooke it out of his mouth; and when he roſe againſt me, I caught him by the beard, and ſmote him, and ſlew him: ſo thy ſeruant ſlew both the Lion and the Beare: therefore this vncircumciſed Philiſtine ſhall be as one of them, ſeeing hee hath railed on the hoſte of the liuing God. In which place,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:15371:11"/>
                  <hi>Dauid,</hi> by the experience which he had in time paſt of Gods help, doth aſſure himſelfe of his help in time to come. This is a ſweete kind of reaſoning, to reaſon from the former proofe and experience of Gods mercies, and therby to ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther confidence and comfort in time to come; ſo that wee may ſay thus to our ſelues; we haue often taſted of the ſweet mercies of God, we haue often bin in great daungers here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore, and yet he hath deliuered vs; that God is as willing and able to help vs now, as before; and he will be ſtil good and gratious vnto vs for euer, if we depend vpon him.</p>
               <p>Thus <hi>Dauid,</hi> vpon the feeling and taſte of Gods former mercies, gathereth the aſſurance of his fauour hereafter; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede he confeſſeth, that for a while there was in him ſome doubt and diſtruſt, when he ſayth, I ſayde in my haſte, all men are liars. Wherein hee ſeemeth to reiect Gods promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and raſhly to cenſure that promiſe of God, made by <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muel,</hi> touching his aduancement to the kingdome. But as wee haue ſeene before, that by his faith hee ouercame this temptation. The Sunne ſometimes is hid vnder cloudes, but yet it ſhineth againe; ſo the faith of Gods ſeruaunts is ſometimes couered and darkened by troubles and ſinnes, yet it will breake foorth againe to their comfort. The ſhip of the ſea is toſſed vp and down with ſtorms and tempeſts, and ſeemeth ſometimes to be in danger of ſhipwracke; but ſo long as the anker holdeth, it cannot periſh: ſo the godly haue many temptations and trialls, yet ſo long as they haue any true faith, which is the ſure and ſtedfaſt anker of the ſoule, they cannot vtterly quaile. The trees ſeeme dead in winter, but yet being ſound at the roote, and hauing iuyce in them, in the ſummer they bud, flouriſh, and bring foorth fruit: ſo the godly, though ſometimes, in reſpect of their great ſinnes and afflictions, ſeeme as dead, yet their faith, hidden for a time in their heart, will flouriſh and ſhew it ſelfe; as we may ſee heere in <hi>Dauids</hi> example, ſo that now he is bolde and confident, and full of the aſſurance of Gods fauour. This makes againſt the damnable doctrine of po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh

                  <hi>our Lord.</hi> The ſame Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Proue your ſelues whether you are in the faith, examine your ſelues, knowe yee not your owne ſelues, how that Ieſus Chriſt is in you except ye be reprobates?</hi> And <hi>Dauid</hi> pronounceth that man bleſſed whoſe wickednes is forgiuen, and whoſe ſinne is couered, and to whome the Lord imputeth not iniquitie. Now what bleſſednes can this be, except a man doe feele and finde this in himſelfe, and be ſure of it? Indeede the beſt ſeruants of God are ſubject to feare, to diſtruſt, to doubtfulnes, and vnbeliefe; but yet they ſtriue againſt theſe, and preuaile in the end. And againſt all temptations, the faith of Gods children is ſtayed and ſetled vpon theſe three props and pillars. The firſt is the mercie of God, being willing and readie to ſaue vs, and promiſing freely ſaluation vnto vs. The ſecond is Gods trueth, who cannot lie, and muſt needes be as good as his word: theſe two were the proppes of <hi>Dauids</hi> faith, God is mercifull and righteous. The third which is menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned in many places, and whereof wee haue in our ſelues ſufficient proofe, is his all-ſufficient power, that he is able to performe whatſoeuer he promiſeth. Let vs oppoſe theſe pillars of our faith againſt all the objections and tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and fierie darts of the Diuell, when we conſider our ſelues, our owne miſeries, our manifold ſinnes, the juſtice of God, we haue cauſe to feare and tremble; but yet hauing theſe grounds, we may caſt off feare, and triumph, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce. When a man ſtandeth vpon the toppe of a tower or ſteeple looking downe to the ground, he feareth and qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth, but when he ſeeth all is ſure vnder him, and about

God will ſpue them out of his mouth. Another vſe of this deliuerance is <hi>Davids</hi> loue to God, which he proteſteth in the firſt verſe, when he ſaith, <hi>I loue the Lord.</hi> And though by courſe I ſhould haue firſt ſpoken of this, yet I haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued it to this place, becauſe his loue proceeded from the experience of Gods great mercie, in deliuering of him, and becauſe his loue to God is the ground of his thankfulneſſe which followeth, <hi>I loue the Lord</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>becauſe hee hath heard my voice and my prayers:</hi> ſo that his loue did ariſe from the remembrance, and feeling of Gods goodnes towardes him.</p>
               <p>Firſt he was in great dangers, then deliuered; whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on he found joy, comfort, and confidence; thereupon hee proteſteth, I loue the Lord. And thus hee beginneth the eighteenth Pſalme, vpon like experience wherein he ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth his inward affection to God, and that he was inwardly kindled and rauiſhed with his loue, as if he ſhould ſay, I lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued the Lord before, but now, vpon triall of new benefits I loue him much more, I loue him only, and aboue al things I haue fixed my loue vpon him, I will loue him, not for a time, but for all my life; he hath ſpared my life, hee hath heard my prayers, he hath fruſtrated my enemies, therefore I will neuer ceaſe to loue him: the more wee receiue, the more we muſt loue; encreaſe of benefits, require encreaſe of loue; euery deliuerance requireth loue; the more our friends doe for vs, the more we are to loue them; there muſt be firſt a feeling of Gods loue, before we can loue him: <hi>We</hi>

Where he ſaith, I will take the cup of ſaluation: he alludeth to the cuſtome of the law, when thoſe whome the Lord de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered from extraordinary diſtreſſe, did vſe in a ſolemne banquet, to take the cup and drinke, making a publike and thankfull acknowledgement of their deliuerance, and with joy, offered ſacrifices vnto the Lord, which did put them in minde of Chriſt, and that they receiued all bleſsings from God for Chriſts ſake.</p>
               <p>They were alſo admoniſhed to giue &amp; conſecrate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues wholy to God, and whereas ſome parte was offered vnto God, they confeſſed that they receiued al things from his hand, and therefore to referre the glorie of all vnto him. To theſe holy feaſtes made in token of ioy, <hi>Dauid</hi> in this <note place="margin">1.

ſignify a publiſhing of Gods praiſe, but alſo prayer and inuocation: ſo that to the former two vſes of his deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, <hi>videlicet</hi> confidence, and loue to God, he ioynes two other, namely, thankefulnes and prayer. His thankeful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes ariſeth from the former loue, ſo that loue is the ground of thankefulnes; and except we loue God, wee can neuer truely praiſe him; and whoſoeuer loueth him aright, they will truely praiſe him: neither is our praiſe, nor anie other duety pleaſing vnto him, except we loue him. Many pray, giue thankes, heare, receiue, and doe many good workes, but they doe it for cuſtome, company, vaineglory, or ſome ſiniſter affection. It is not the loue of God that ſettes them on worke, and therefore they cannot pleaſe God. We muſt learne then, that the loue of God is the roote of all true pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie: therefore ſaith God, And now Iſrael, what dooth the Lorde thy God require of thee, but to feare the Lorde thy God, to walke in all his wayes, and to loue him, and to ſerue the Lord thy God, with all thy heart, and with all thy <note place="margin">Deut. 10. 12.</note>ſoule? And our Sauiour Chriſt comprehendeth the whole lawe in theſe two pointes, to loue God aboue all, and our <note place="margin">Mat. 22. 40.</note>neighbour as our ſelues: On theſe two commaundements (ſaith Chriſt) hangeth all the lawe and the prophets. The <note place="margin">2. Cor. 5. 14.</note>Apoſtle ſaith, that the loue of Chriſt conſtrained him to do his duety. And <hi>Dauid,</hi> hauing before ſet downe God his goodneſſe, vpon experience of which, hee proteſted that he loued him: now from that loue hee brake out into theſe wordes; What ſhall I render vnto the Lorde? Before hee ſaith, I loue the Lord: now he ſaith, What ſhall I render vnto him? ſo that as one ſaieth, Praiſes not iſſuing from loue, are either flatteries, or hypocriſies. God and <hi>Dauid</hi> entred into couenant each with other, God promiſing to multiply vppon him his bleſsings: <hi>Dauid</hi> promiſing to <note place="margin">Pſal. 89. 3. 35.</note>God againe, loue, kindnes, and obedience. God ſaieth, I haue made a couenant with my choſen. I haue ſworn once by my Holineſſe, that I will not faile <hi>Dauid, Dauid</hi> againe ſware to the Lord, and vowed to the mighty God of <hi>Iacob,</hi>
                  <pb n="19" facs="tcp:15371:15"/>
ſaying, I will not enter into the tabernacle of my houſe, nor come vpon my pallet, or bed, nor ſuffer mine eyes to ſleepe, nor my eye-liddes to ſlumber, vntill I finde out a place for the Lord, an habitation for the mightie God of <hi>Iacob:</hi> wherein hee promiſeth to haue more care of Gods religion, and of his glory, than of any worldly thing what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer. And in this place he promiſeth all loue and kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe vnto God: but firſt note heere <hi>Dauids</hi> humility, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſsing his owne inſufficiencie to perfourme any duety to God, as if he ſhould ſay, though I haue a care to be thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, yet I owe more than I am able to repay; I am loaden with Gods bleſsings, and altogether weake, impotent any way to requite him. He confeſſeth there is no proportion betwixt Gods benefits, and his power to requite. This hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility was in <hi>Iacob</hi> when he ſaith, I am not worthy the leaſt <note place="margin">Gen. 32. 10.</note>of all the mercies and trueths which thou haſt ſhewed vnto thy ſeruant.

Gods benefits do make the wicked prowd, honors change manners in them; they are puffed vp, and forget themſelues, as we may ſee in <hi>Saul, Nabuchad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nezzar</hi> and others. Thus the Lord ſpeakes to the Church of <hi>Laodicea,</hi> Thou ſaieſt I am rich, and encreaſed with goodes, and haue neede of nothing, and knoweſt not how thou arte wretched, miſerable, blinde, poore and naked.

the Goſpell, but good men are lowlie and humble, and the more humbled by the bleſsings of God. Thankfulneſſe muſt ariſe from the conſideration of Gods benefits, &amp; our owne vnworthineſſe, and ſo we mooue our benefactor to be more beneficiall vnto vs. True thankfulnes doth not glorie of merits, doth not boaſt of worthines; for this is, of a benefactor, to make God a debtor vnto vs, and ſo wee turne his affection from vs. The Apoſtle ſaith, I count that the afflictions of this preſent time, are not worthy of the glory which ſhall be ſhewed vnto vs. There can bee no greater, nor better worke, than to ſuffer for Chriſts ſake, to leeſe liuing and life, and all for him, and yet this doth not merit eternall life: therefore there is no worke meritori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in the holy ſight of God, onely the worke of Chriſts death doth merit ſaluation for vs.</p>
               <p>And heere againe is the mercy, and liberality of God, who requireth not equall recompence of vs for his bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits; he is perfect, nothing can be added vnto him, his bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedneſſe and glory is euerlaſting, he hath no neede of vs at all. Chriſt ſaith, I receiue not praiſe of men: whatſoeuer good thing we haue, it is from him, and it is he that muſt giue vs heartes to praiſe him: and our beſt ſeruice, as it commeth from vs, is ſtayned and polluted: yet is our good and gratious God content to accept from our hands our weake prayers, praiſes, and other duties, if they proceede from faith, loue, and kindneſſe vnto him. And though we cannot merit at all, though we be weake and vnperfect in euerie dutie, yet there is required of vs, a care, and deſire to performe all duties: this is a ſure and perfect note of Gods <note place="margin">Nehem. 1. 11.</note>children.

Now what ſhall we render vnto thee for all theſe great benefits beſtowed vpon vs? O good God, enlarge our harts and mouthes to praiſe thee. And marke further in <hi>Dauid,</hi> that in the time of his diſtreſſe, he calleth and cryeth vnto God as we heard before, now being deliuered, he doth ſtirre vp himſelfe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thankfulneſſe, ſo that the ſame ſpirit which teacheth to pray, the ſame ſpirit teacheth to giue thanks. Pray continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally ſaith the Apoſtle, in all things giue thanks, for this is the will of God in Chriſt Ieſus towards you. Many pray, eſpecially in time of dangers, but few giue thanks. In time of troubles the very wicked and hypocrites are forced to call vpon God: wicked <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> when the plagues were vpon him, deſired <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> to pray for him. God ſaith of his people, In their affliction they will ſeeke me di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently: and indeede afflictions are good meanes to whet on the prayers of Gods children, but yet to our prayers we muſt joyne thankſgiuing. As we are readie and willing in our miſeries and wants to call vpon God, and to cry to him for his help; ſo being helped and deliuered, we muſt bee as readie and willing to giue him thanks. Our Sauiour Chriſt vpbraydeth, and reprooueth the nine Lepers which were clenſed by him, for their vnthankfulneſſe: for when one of <note place="margin">Luc. 17.</note>them (being tenne in number) ſaw that he was healed, tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned backe, and with a loude voice prayſed God, and fell downe on his face at his feete, and gaue him thanks, Ieſus ſaid vnto him, <hi>Are there not ten clenſed? but where are the nine? there are none found that returned to giue God thankes ſaue this ſtranger:</hi> ſo that the greateſt number are forgetfull, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mindfull of this dutie of prayſing God. And marke I pray you, who it is in this place, that is ſo carefull and reſolute to performe this dutie. It is <hi>Dauid,</hi> a holy man according to Gods owne heart, he excelleth in prayſes, ſo that it is no na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall, no common gift, but a gift of Gods ſpirit, peculiar <note place="margin">Pſal. 65. 1.</note>to his owne people, to praiſe him: therefore ſaith <hi>Dauid, O

ſaid of magiſtrates and miniſters, is ſaid vnto all, that they ſhould praiſe the Lord, and magnifie his majeſtie for his benefits.

Shall I giue my firſt borne for my tranſgreſsion, euen the fruit of my body for the ſinne of my ſoule? &amp;c. But all theſe are nothing without faith and obedience. And therfore <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muel</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">1. Sam. 15. 22. Ier. 7.</note>ſaith to <hi>Saul, To obey is better than ſacrifice.</hi> And in <hi>Ieremy</hi> the Lord telleth the hypocrites, the chiefe thing he requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, was to obey his voice. And <hi>Dauid</hi> ſaith, Thou deſireſt no ſacrifice, though I would giue it, thou delighteſt not in burnt offerings; the ſacrifice of God is a contrite ſpirite, a contrite and a broken heart, O God, thou wilt not deſpiſe. Thoſe externall ſacrifices were eaſily performed by hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites: but God then chiefly, and now alſo, requireth, loue, obedience, and thankefulneſſe. <hi>Dauid</hi> promiſeth and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formeth publique and great praiſes, for publique and great benefits. He ſaith after in this Pſalme, I wil pay my vowes vnto the Lord, euen now in the preſence of all his people, in the courts of the Lords houſe, euen in the middeſt of thee, <note place="margin">Pſal. 22. 22.</note>O <hi>Ieruſalem.</hi> And in another place he ſaith, I will declare thy name vnto my brethren, in the middeſt of the congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion will I praiſe thee. A publique confeſsion and praiſing of God is required for publique benefites; but many are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed openly to profeſſe God; they are not aſhamed to ſinne, but are aſhamed to doe well. They are not aſhamed openly to receiue bleſsings, be they neuer ſo many, but are aſhamed openly to praiſe God for them. The people of

God had wont to haue two kindes of extraordinary holie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dayes, the one of ſorrow, the other of ioy, the one for humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation, and the other for thankeſgiuing. In time of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like dangers, they had their daies of faſting; after great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverances, they had their daies of joy and thankſgiuing: for proofe of both, let vs conſider but two examples. The one is of King <hi>Iehoſophat,</hi> who when he ſaw his enemies rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die to inuade him, he proclaymed a faſt throughout all Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da, and they came all together, and humbled themſelues in faſting and prayer before the Lord. But when the Lord gaue them a happie victorie ouer their enemies, they aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled themſelues in the valley of <hi>Beracah,</hi> for there they bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the Lord, therefore they called the name of that place, the valley of <hi>Beracah</hi> vnto this day, that is, the valley of bleſsing and thankſgiuing. The meaning is, they had a <note place="margin">2. Chron. 20. 3. 26.</note>holy aſſemblie, an extraordinary day of publike rejoycing before the Lord for ſo great deliuerance. The other is, the example of Queene <hi>Eſter,</hi> who when ſhe ſaw, that the death <note place="margin">Eſter 4. 15.</note>of <hi>Mordecai,</hi> and the Iewes was conſpired and decreed by the meanes of prowde <hi>Haman,</hi> ſhe commandeth <hi>Mordecai</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Eſter 8. 17.</note>to aſſemble all the Iewes that are found in <hi>Shuſhan,</hi> and that they ſhould faſt and humble their ſoules extraordinarily, and ſhe promiſeth that ſhe and her maides wil doe the like. But after, when the faithfulnes of Gods people was know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en to the King, they were deliuered, and the trechery of <hi>Haman</hi> was reuealed, and he himſelfe hanged vpon the gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes he prepared for another: then there was another holiday kept by the Iewes, a feaſt and good day, a day of joy and gladnes for their deliuerance. And marke further, the zeale, deſire, and feruencie of <hi>Dauid</hi> in prayſing God, What ſaith he ſhall I render to the Lord, &amp;c. The beſt are ſlow and ſlacke, heauie and dull in performing any dutie to God, but yet the Saints of God when they ſet themſelues to praiſe him, they cannot be ſatisfied, they cannot ſtay themſelues, they thinke all too little, they are ouerwhel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med with Gods mercies, they cannot comprehend them,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:15371:19"/>
they are aſtoniſhed at them, they would gratifie him if they could, they ſtirre and prouoke themſelues to do what they can, they would doe more if they could, their deſire and affection is more then they can performe. And <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid</hi> of all other, heere, and other-where, is a liuely patterne of true thankfulnes. In this place there be in him many notes and markes of a true thankfull heart. Firſt, he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgeth Gods benefits. Secondly, he doth amplify and magnifie them. Thirdly, he confeſſeth his own weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes and inſufficiencie. Fourthly, he deſired, and joyeth to gratifie the Lord any way.

                  <hi>mine eyes vnto the mountaines from whence my help ſhall come, my helpe commeth from the Lord which hath made heauen and earth.</hi> How often doth he vowe and promiſe to be thankfull? how many argumeuts doth he vſe, to mooue and prouoke him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe and others to true thankefulneſſe? how many Pſalmes be there of praiſe and thankeſgiuing? how many beginne and end with this exhortation, Praiſe yee the Lord? Lette therefore all Chriſtians learne from this Doctor and prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titioner of thankefulneſſe, to be truely thankeful. And let vs obſerue further from this example, that <hi>Dauid</hi> dooth not onely conſult, purpoſe, and promiſe to be thankefull, but doth indeede performe it, as we may ſee in the verſes follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing in this Pſalme. Many promiſe and purpoſe good things, and yet neuer performe them. Euery lawfull pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe is debt, and therefore to be truely payde. When thou haſt vowed a vowe to God, ſaith the Wiſeman, deferre not to pay it, for he delighteth not in fooles: Pay therefore that
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:15371:20"/>
thou haſt vowed. <hi>It is better that thou ſhouldeſt not vow, than that thou ſhouldeſt vowe, and not pay it. Eccl.</hi> 5. 3. <hi>Dauid</hi> ſaith, <note place="margin">Pſal. 66. 13.</note>I will goe into thine houſe with burnt offerings, and will pay thee my vowes which my lippes haue promiſed, and my mouth hath ſpoken in my affliction. And againe, <hi>I</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Pſal. 119. 106.</note>
                  <hi>haue ſworne, and will performe it, that I will keepe thy righteous iudgements.</hi> Therefore he ſaith in an other place, vow and performe vnto the Lord your God, all yee that are round a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout <note place="margin">Pſalme 76. 11.</note>him: Let them bring preſents vnto him that ought to be feared, worke againe the quickeneſſe and expedition of <hi>Dauid,</hi> in performing this duety of praiſe without any delay at all: and therefore he ſaith in the verſe following, I will pay my vowes vnto the Lorde, euen now in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of all his people; hee doth not deferre and put it off, but vpon a receipt of new benefits, hee offereth new ſongs of praiſe vnto God. Delayes are daungerous, eſpecially in <note place="margin">Pſalm. 119. 60</note>Gods matters. Therefore ſaith <hi>Dauid, I made haſte, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>layed not to keepe thy commaundements.</hi> Therefore, worthy is that ſaying to be marked of all, eſpecially of Kings and <note place="margin">Ezra 7. 23.</note>Magiſtrates. Whatſoeuer is by the commaundement of the God of heauen, let it be done ſpeedily for the houſe of the God of heauen. And finally, lette vs obſerue the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancie of <hi>Dauid,</hi> hee is no changeling, but the ſame, both in aduerſitie and proſperitie. In his troubles he calleth and cryeth mightily vpon God; after his deliuerance hee is oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupied in praiſing God, and magnifying his moſt holie name.</p>
               <p>Neither aduerſitie nor proſperitie doth hinder him, but further him in the worſhippe of God. In his daungers hee cryeth to God for helpe, and now being deliuered, all his care is to loue God, to pleaſe God, and to praiſe him. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing purſued vniuſtly, and maliciouſly, by <hi>Saul</hi> and his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herents, hee dooth not rebell, nor take armour againſt the Lords annoynted, but his chiefe armour and weapons are teares, patience, and prayer: and now hauing eſcaped, he is not careleſſe, wanton, prowd: he doth not giue himſelfe
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:15371:20"/>
to carnal pleaſures, but to ſpiritual joy and thankeſgiuing. Thus <hi>Dauid,</hi> both in the time of his affliction, &amp; in the time of his proſperitie, ſheweth himſelfe, a godly, holy, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious man, <hi>If any be afflicted,</hi> ſaith <hi>Iames, let him pray, if any</hi>

We muſt not in time of proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peritie, and after great deliueraunces, liue in ſecuritie and wantonneſſe, but in greater obedience and thankefulneſſe vnto God.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Deut. 32. 15</note> The Lord complaines thus of his people; He that ſhould haue beene vpright, when he waxed fat, ſpurned with his heele; Thou art fatte, thou arte groſſe, thou arte laden with fatneſſe, therefore hee forſooke God that made him, and regarded not the ſtrong God of his ſaluation.

Therefore, ſaieth <hi>Salomon, Eaſe ſlayeth the fooliſh, and the proſperitie of fooles deſtroyeth them.</hi> Many fall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way <note place="margin">Prouerbs 1</note>from God by afflictions, through impatience and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpaire; but more fall away from him by proſperitie, tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row ſecuritie, pride, wantonneſſe, and vnthankefulneſſe. But <hi>Dauid</hi> is conſtant to God, and ſticketh faſt to him, both in the time of his daungers, and in the time of his ſafetie, in neither of theſe ſtates, he falleth from God, but holdeth faſt the courſe of godlines. And that we may follow this wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy patterne, becauſe we are of our ſelues, weake, and dull, let vs conſider ſome motiues and arguments, to mooue and inforce vs to this holy duety of thankefulneſſe. And firſt, the knowledge, feeling, and remembraunce of Gods bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits will mooue vs to this duetie; therefore let vs not forget, but keepe in memorie, a regiſter of the bleſsings of God.
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:15371:21"/>
Hereupon <hi>Dauid,</hi> when <hi>Abigail,</hi> by her counſell ſtayed him <note place="margin">1. Sam. 25. 32.</note>from ſheding of <hi>Nabals</hi> bloud, hee giueth thankes, both to God, and her, ſaying, Bleſſed be the Lord God of Iſraell, which ſent thee this day to meete mee, and bleſſed be thy counſell, and bleſſed be thou, which haſt kept me this day from comming to ſhed blood, and that my hand hath not ſaued mee. And <hi>Dauid</hi> in many Pſalmes dooth often re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member and record the manifold bleſsings of God, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoke himſelfe to thankefulnes. And the Lord himſelfe, for the furtherance of our memorie hath ordained and ſet vppe many monuments of his benefites, as the Sabath of the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of the world, and our redemption, the Rainebowe, a monument of not drowning the world, the Paſſeouer, of their deliuerance out of <hi>Aegipt,</hi> the twelue Stones ſet vp in <hi>Gilgal,</hi> as a monument of their paſsing through <hi>Iorden.</hi> And finally, the Lords Supper was ordained as a perpetuall me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morie of the Paſsion of Chriſt. Secondly, if we wil be right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thankfull, there muſt be in the heart, a true inward ioy: after feeling of ioy followeth praiſe: giuing of thankes is according to the quantitie and meaſure of ioy: and where there is no ioy, there is no praiſe. And therefore the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple <note place="margin">Pſalme 126</note>of God ſay thus, <hi>When the Lord brought againe the capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uitie of Sion, we were like them that dreamed, then was our mouth filled with laughter, and our tongue with ioy.</hi> Thirdly, the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion of our hart, that the bleſsings of god proceed from the loue and fauor of God to vs, will greatly moue vs to be thankefull. Our Sauiour Chriſt ſaith, If yee which are e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill, can giue good giftes to your children, how much more ſhall your heauenly Father giue the holie ghoſt to them that deſire it? By which place hee teacheth, that God is the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the faithfull, that they are his children, that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer he beſtoweth vpon them, is in loue; and therefore they muſt ſhew them loue againe, by giuing of thankes. The bleſsings of God vpon the wicked, are not in loue, but in wrath, and therefore no maruell thogh they be vnthank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full. Fourthly, All the creatures of God moue vs to thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:15371:21"/>
euery creature a benefit to man, to prouoke him to praiſe; the beauty, order, power, and workmanſhip of the creatures doe call vpon vs to glorifie the Creator; they are all for our vſe, and ſerue vs. Hee might haue made vs like the vileſt, but he hath made vs moſt noble, and the chiefe of all creatures in the earth. All theſe conſiderations ſhoulde mooue vs to praiſe him. It is recorded of a godly man, that ſaid in this maner; Bleſſed be God who hath made innume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable and wonderfull creatures, whereof there is none but he teacheth me to praiſe him. Another anſwered, how doth a toade teach thee to praiſe God? Very much, ſaith he, For when I behold that creature, ſo vgly, foule, and venomous, I conſider, that God might haue made me ſo; but hee hath made me an excellent and reaſonable creature: ſo that here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by I haue occaſion to praiſe God. Another, when he ſawe a foule great toade, cried and wept: and being asked why? he ſaide, becauſe I neuer praiſed God for making me ſo no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble a creature in body and minde, whereas hee might haue made me a worme, or a foule toade: and this hee hath done to me, not of my deſert, but of his meere mercie, for which I was neuer yet thankefull. O the filthy blot of vnthanke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe, for the which, why ſhoulde I not all my whole life conſume my ſelfe with teares? Many thouſands in the world haue cauſe to mourne, who were neuer yet thankful at all, for creation, or redemption, and other bleſsings tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall and ſpirituall, and the beſt of vs all haue cauſe to bee grieued for our great vnthankefulnes to God for his mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folde and great bleſsings ſo long time beſtowed vppon vs. So many creatures as there be in the world, ſo many bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits as wee haue receiued, are ſo many arguments and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiues to drawe vs to thankefulneſſe. Fiftly, Let vs conſider the excellencie and the majeſtie of the Giuer, our owne vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthineſſe and ingratitude, the great and manifolde bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings ſo long time beſtowed vhpon vs. The giuer is God the creator of heauen and earth, almighty, immortall, inui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, holy, juſt, and glorious: we are mortall, duſt and aſhes,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:15371:22"/>
poore wormes of the earth, wretched and miſerable, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane, vnholy, and ſinfull, the children of wrath and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation: the benefites which he beſtoweth vpon vs, are great, and many, priuate, publique, temporall, ſpirituall. Concerning this life, and the life to come, through him wee liue, moue, and haue our being; by him we are fedde, and preſerued from many dangers, hee hath made vs his owne children, he hath choſen, and redeemed vs, and hee hath promiſed to glorifie vs; he hath giuen vs his word, his ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, his owne Sonne and Spirite; from him wee haue al comforts both of ſoule and body. The due conſideration of all theſe things together may cauſe vs to ſay with the Prophet, <hi>Lord, what is man that thou arte mindefull of him, and the ſonne of man that thou viſitest him? Pſal.</hi> 8. 4. And to ſay a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine with him in this place, <hi>What ſhall I render vnto the Lord for all his benefites bestowed vpon me?</hi> Sixtly, thankeſgiuing is a part of Gods worſhip, and the compliment of prayer, ſo that prayer is vnperfect and lame without it; therefore the <note place="margin">Phil. 4. 6.</note>Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>In all things let your requests be ſhewed vnto God in prayer and ſupplication, with giuing of thankes.</hi> Seauenthly, Thankfulnes is a meanes to imbolden and aſſure vs of fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther graces heereafter, and doth cauſe vs to vſe thoſe well, holily, and rightly which wee haue: and therefore ſaieth one, aſcending of thankes, is the deſcending of grace. And againe, <hi>Deſunt gratis, quia nos ingrats:</hi> that is, Graces are wanting, becauſe wee are vnthankeful. And how can wee looke for any more bleſsings at Gods handes? With what face can we deſire them of him, if wee bee vnthankefull for thoſe which wee haue receiued already? And this maketh vs alſo rightly to vſe the giftes of God; for how can it be, that we ſhould abuſe them, if wee confeſſe that we receiue them from the hands of God, enjoy them as in his preſence, and be thankefull for them as meates and drinkes; ſo all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther bleſsings are ſanctified by praier, and praiſing of God. Eightly, By thankeſgiuing we receiue benefite and profit, as we haue partly ſeene; as it is our due<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>y, ſo it is our owne
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:15371:22"/>
good: therefore one ſaith, <hi>Benignus exactor, &amp; non egenus, qui non creſcit ex redditis, ſed in ſe facit creſcere redditores:</hi> that is, God is not a needie, but a kinde demaunder, who doth not increaſe with that which is giuen him, but cauſeth it to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe in them which giueth him. Ninthly, Thankſgiuing is a debt to God, and therefore to be duely payd; by his benefites wee are greatly indebted vnto him, and this the Prophet confeſſeth in this place, What ſhall I render vnto the Lord? as if he ſhould ſay, I am farre indebted vnto the Lord, I am bound in equitie to pay it, and I am ready and willing, ſo farre as lieth in my power. Tenthly, thankeſgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing is a part of our ſpiritual ſacrifice: and the apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Let vs by Chriſt offer the ſacrifice of praiſe alwayes to God,</hi> that <note place="margin">Hebr. 13. 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

                     <g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </note>is, <hi>the fruite of the lippes which confeſſe his Name.</hi> It is no baſe ſeruice or worke, but a ſpirituall ſacrifice, the exerciſe of the Saints in earth and heauen; nay, it is a royall and angelicall woorke to praiſe God, as wee may ſee in the 103. Pſalme, and in the fourth and fift chapter of the <hi>Apocalips:</hi> Finally, thankefulneſſe is an honour due to Gods name, it is the law of Equitie and Nature, the very heathen hauing victories, haue praiſed their falſe gods: all creatures in their kinde praiſe God, wee can neuer ſufficiently praiſe him. It is a good thing, it is pleaſaunt, and praiſe is comely, ſaieth the Prophet; therefore, lette vs all with heart and tongue, and life, priuately and openly praiſe our good God for his wonderfull and manifolde bleſsings con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually beſtowed vpon vs.</p>

times heeretofore haue bin deuiſed againſt our Prince, Church, and Countrey by the wicked Papiſts: many ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till and bloudy conſpiracies haue bin plotted and attemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by them; but this of late ſurpaſſeth and ſurmounteth all, ſo that this plot is rightly called by one, Legion, which containeth the number of ſix thouſand diuells: for howſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer their intent and meaning may be, was heretofore to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthrow the Goſpel, and profeſſors of it; yet their chiefe attempt, was moſt, and directly againſt the life of her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſty, our gratious ſoueraigne good Queene <hi>Elizabeth</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede then (vnder God) the breath of our noſthrilles. But now this late plot was more cruell and bloody, purpoſing in one day, by one terrible blow, not onely to cutt off our gratious King, but Queene, and royal iſſue, nobles, coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell, gentry, the chiefe in blood, wiſedome, learning, graui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie in the whole land, the higher and lower houſe of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the ſtrong man, the man of warre, the Iudge and the prophet, the prudent and the aged, the honourable and the counſellor, and the eloquent man, the worthies of our land, the horſemen and the chariots of Iſrael. This was their plot and purpoſe, and they made full accompt of it, in a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to ouerthrow all theſe. But I lacke skill and cunning, wordes and eloquence, to lay out ſufficiently the malice, ſubtiltie, barbarous cruelty, the height, breadth, and depth of this ſo treacherous an attempt. For the further and more full deſcription of it, I referre you to the gratious ſpeech of his Maieſty, and the diſcouery of this treaſon, in a booke publiſhed by authoritie. Oh in what caſe had this poore land beene in, if they had brought their purpoſe to paſſe! Thoſe which remained aliue, had beene at their wittes end, as a body without a head, ſheepe without a ſhepheard, and ſo a preſent prey to the woolfe. If this had come to paſſe, then the Papiſts had got their day which they long gaped for: all ſound preachers and profeſſors had beene cut off, the Goſpel ſuppreſſed, the idolatrous maſſe ſet vp and eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed.

Let the aged be asked, let auntient hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries be read, let Chronicles be throughly ſearched, and ſee if there were euer any the like crueltie or treachery, to this treachery in the Vault. <hi>Simeon</hi> and <hi>Leui</hi> (ſaith <hi>Iacob)</hi> bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren in euill, the inſtruments of crueltie, are in their habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, into their ſecret let not my ſoule come: my glorie, be not thou joyned with their aſſembly, for in their wrath they ſlew a man, and in their ſelfe-wil they digged downe <note place="margin">Geneſis 49. 5</note>a wall, curſed be their wrath that was fierce, and their rage for it was cruell. The treachery and crueltie of <hi>Simeon</hi> and <hi>Leui</hi> is ſet out in another place, when their ſiſter <hi>Dina</hi> was <note place="margin">Geneſis 34.</note>rauiſhed by <hi>Shechim</hi> the ſonne of <hi>Hamor,</hi> and after he was content to marry her, and he and the Shecamites were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to be in league with <hi>Iacob,</hi> and to be circumciſed: theſe two ſons of <hi>Iacob, Simeon</hi> and <hi>Leui</hi> came vpon <hi>Hamor</hi> and <hi>Shechim,</hi> &amp; their people being ſore, and ſlew them with the ſword. This was a cruel and treacherous part, but they had ſome colour and pretence for it; their ſiſter was defiled and made a whoore, and thed did it in reuenge. But our enimies can haue no ſuch juſt colour or pretence. It was a great cruelty in <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> to purpoſe, and commaund to kill euery manchilde of the Hebrewes, but yet this was by publique <note place="margin">Exodus 1.</note>Edict; and they were the children of his vaſſals.

Vnnaturall, and moſt cruell was <hi>Abimelech,</hi> in killing his brethren, about ſeauenty perſons. As cruell was <hi>Iehoram,</hi> in killing his brethren with the ſword. As cruell was <hi>Athaliah</hi> who deſtroyed all the kings ſeed of the houſe of <hi>Iudah;</hi> but yet the rage and fury of theſe was ſtaied and ſtanched in the bloud royall.

Then they cried vnto the Lord, and ſaide, We beſeech thee, O Lord, we beſeech thee, let vs not periſh for <note place="margin">Actes 28.</note>this mans life, and lay not vpon vs innocent bloud. When <hi>Paul</hi> was at <hi>Mileta,</hi> the Barbarians vſed him kindly, and kindled a fire for him and his company: and <hi>Paul</hi> gathering a few ſtickes, and laying them vpon the fire, there came a viper out of the heate, and leaped vppon his hand, which when the Barbarians ſaw, they ſaide amongeſt themſelues, this man ſurely is a murtherer, whome though hee hath eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caped the ſea, yet vengeance hath not ſuffered to liue: by which place we ſee, that although the judgement of theſe men was raſh againſt <hi>Paul,</hi> yet, that murther is deteſtable in the judgement of Barbarians and Infidels.

The people of Iſrael, becauſe they rebelled againſt <hi>Moſes,</hi> haue this puniſhment laide vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them by the Lord, that they are ſhut out from the ſight <note place="margin">Numb. 16.</note>of the land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> promiſed to their fathers, <hi>Korah, Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than,</hi> and <hi>Abiram:</hi> becauſe they rebelled againſt <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron,</hi> the earth opened her mouth, and ſwallowed them vp, with their families, and all the men that were with them, <note place="margin">2.

Chron. 36.</note>and treaſon, though it was againſt a wicked and ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrous king, his eies were put out, and hee was bound in <note place="margin">Eſter 2. 22.</note>chaines, and his ſonnes were ſlaine before him.

Thus we ſee the manifolde examples, the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable end of traitors and rebells, that either they are cutte off by the hand of man, or elſe the Lord himſelfe doth exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute judgement vpon them. And let me adde yet one more, the fearefull example of <hi>Iudas</hi> an Apoſtle, a profeſſor and preacher of the Goſpel, and yet the childe of perdition, and a traitor againſt his owne Maiſter Chriſt Ieſus. After hee had wrought his treaſon, and betraied Chriſt into the hands of his enemies, he became deſperate, and hanged himſelfe. And let vs conſider our owne times, hath not God alwayes diſcouered the manifolde treaſons and treacheries againſt our gratious Queene <hi>Elizabeth?</hi> Haue not the chiefe Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thours of them had experience of this hand of God? Haue not ſome fled their countrey, ſome killed themſelues? And were not others cut off by the ſword? And touching theſe late conſpirators, hath not the Lord brought them to ſhame and confuſion? Were not ſome of the chiefe of them mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:15371:30"/>
and ſome killed with powlder, wherewith they made accompt to haue killed many thouſands. Wherein we may obſerue the juſt judgement of God vpon them, and wee ſee that verified, <hi>In quo peccamus, in eodem plectimur;</hi> In the ſame thing we ſinne, in the ſame thing wee are puniſhed. Many other of this conſpiracie are in holde, and abide the ſword of the Magiſtrate, and I doubt not but God will more and more diſcouer and bring to ſhame, the authors, fauourers, and friends of this bloudy conſpiracie.</p>

                  <p>BVt theſe rebells will object and ſay for themſelues, that both our King, and wee, are heretikes, and therefore excommunicated and curſed by their holy father the Pope, ſo that they may juſtly, and by authoritie from him, cutte vs <note place="margin">Actes 24. 14.</note>off. But wee anſwere with Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> By that way which you call Hereſie, we worſhip the Lord God of our fathers, beleeuing all things which are written in the Lawe and the Prophets. You indeede count him an heretike which obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not all the Popes Decrees, Legends, and Fables: but if wee were ſuch as yee would haue vs, who hath giuen the Pope authoritie to curſe our King, and vs: Where hath hee any power from Patriarke, Prophet, Chriſt, Apoſtles, God, or Angells, to curſe the Lordes annoynted? Euen as much as he hath for treaſons &amp; rebellions; but of this more here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after. I will now anſwer you as one anſwereth the bruitiſh thunderbolt of Pope <hi>Sixtus</hi> the fift, againſt <hi>Henrie</hi> the moſt excellent King of <hi>Nauarre,</hi> and the moſt noble, <hi>Henry Bour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bon</hi> prince of <hi>Condie,</hi> he anſwereth, that the Pope is a Iudge incompetent and inſufficient, therefore the ſentence is void. The Pope, ſaieth he, hath beene long agoe condemned by the moſt parte of Chriſtendome, viz. <hi>England, Scotland, Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marke, Sweueland,</hi> the moſt parte of <hi>Germany,</hi> and the moſt part of <hi>Heluetia,</hi> for ſeauen grieuous crimes: Firſt, for impi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie.

Secondly, for tirannie. Thirdly, for corrupt religion. Fourthly, for ſacriledge. Fiftly, for treaſon. Sixtly, for rebellion. Seauenthly, for forgery. Now till hee purge himſelfe of theſe and other grieuous crimes, he is not fit to judge or accuſe the baſeſt amongſt vs; and indeede no man may be Iudge in his owne cauſe. And further hee ſaith, that the cauſe of vnjuſt excommunication, redoundeth v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the head of him that accurſeth, according to the ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of <hi>Auguſtine, intemerarium,</hi> raſh judgment doth for the moſt part hurt him nothing: vpon whom judgement is raſhly giuen; but him that judgeth raſhly, muſt the raſhnes of neceſsitie hurt. And it followeth, what doth it hurt a man, that mans ignorance will blot him out of that table, if ſo be an euill conſcience doth not blot him out of the booke of the liuing? Thinke of <hi>Auguſtine</hi> what thou wilt, only let not my conſcience accuſe mee in the eyes of God. And againe, though thou be condemned of man for a time, the earthly ſeate is one, and the heauenly throne is another: from the lower thou receiueſt ſentence, from the higher a crowne. I will ſay that boldly, and not raſhly, that if any of the faithfull be vnjuſtly accuſed, it ſhall rather hurt him that doth, then him that ſuffereth this injurie. For the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ghoſt that dwelleth in the Saints, by whome euery man is bound and looſed, doth not puniſh any man vndeſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uedly.

Are wee not by the Sacrament more neerely vnited to Chriſt and his member? Is it not a meanes of growth in grace, in loue, in thankefulneſſe and holineſſe? From hence lette mee vſe an argument againſt tranſubſtantiation; Chriſt ſaieth in the ſixt of <hi>Iohn, He that eateth my fleſh, and drinketh my bloud, he dwelleth in me, and I in him.</hi> But Chriſt dwelleth not in traitors and murtherers: and therefore yee were not truely partakers of his fleſh and bloud, yee tooke the Sacrament of the Lord againſt the Lord, hee tooke with <hi>Iudas,</hi> a ſoppe, and then went with him to betray your maiſter. But yee ſay you haue bound your ſelues to the performance of theſe plotts and practiſes, by vowes, promiſes, oathes; and therefore muſt needes per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme them. Indeede many are ſo fooliſh, that they thinke all promiſes and othes are to be kept: that which they are not bound to keepe, they are moſt carefull to keepe. That which God commaundeth, and which they by promiſe are bound to doe, they haue leaſt care and conſcience to keepe. Such othes and promiſes as are againſt the rule of faith and charitie, may ſafely be broken. Indeede the Lord ſaieth, Whoſoeuer voweth a vowe to the Lorde, or ſweareth an <note place="margin">Num. 30. 3.</note>oath, to binde himſelfe by a bond, hee ſhall not breake his promiſe, but ſhall doe according to all which proceedeth out of his mouth. But it followeth; if a woman vow a vow to the Lord, and binde her ſelfe by a bond, being in her fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers houſe, in the time of her youth, and her father heare her vow and bond wherewith ſhe hath bound her ſelfe and her father hold his peace concerning her, then all her vowes

Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ye wil not beleeue the truth of his word and the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full miniſters of the Goſpel; he hath giuen you ouer to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue legends, lies, fables, falſe, ſeditious, treacherous, blou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy antichriſtian teachers. And are ye not aſhamed? doe ye not bluſh? doe yee not quake and tremble, to thinke of this vnnaturall, brutiſh, monſtrous, and bloudy late conſpiracy? the like whereof is not heard of amongſt the Pagans and Infidelles. And though I doubt not but ſome of you are not ſo farre paſt grace, but that your heartes will melt and mourne for theſe bloudy finnes; yet it is ſaide of ſome, that they be ſo deſperate and impudent, that they are ſory for nothing, and repent of nothing they haue doone, but onely this is their griefe, that their malitious and curſed plott had not that effect which they looked for. But O graceleſſe wretches, if yee had brought to paſſe your curſed purpoſes, yet God no doubt would haue beene reuenged of you. The Lord might juſtly haue done it for our ſinnes, though you had no ſuch meaning to correct ſinne in vs. It is not ſinne, but grace, &amp; our profeſsion which you hate and perſecute: If that had come to paſſe which you looked for, you had bin Gods roddes to whippe vs; but after that God had whip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped vs by you, would he not haue caſt the roddes in the fire?

Could he not haue ſtirred vp others to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge our cauſe? Could he not haue tormented your conſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciences, and driuen you to deſperation, and ſo haue made you a hang-man to your owne ſelues? Could he not many wayes haue curſed you, your wife and children? And muſt ye not both now and then periſh eternally, without great repentance? What a curſed name ſhould you, and ſhall ſtill leaue behind you, of rebels, traitors and murtherers, ſo long as the world endureth? And finally, who would euer haue truſted you, ſo long as yee had liued, hauing beene ſo falſe and treacherous to your Soueraigne and natiue countrey? And now, as it is, remember the ſayings of <hi>Salomon,</hi> The <note place="margin">Pro. 16. 14, 15.</note>wrath of a King is as meſſengers of death, but a wiſe man will pacific it. In the light of the Kings countenance, is life, and his ſauour is like as a cloud of the latter raine.

ſtirred vp one enemie or other againſt them. We haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belled againſt the Lorde, and therefore our enemies may juſtly rebell againſt vs. We haue ſet our ſelues one againſt another, &amp; therefore they may juſtly ſet themſelues againſt vs. We deuiſe plots one againſt another, and therefore the Lord may juſtly ſtirre vp cur enimies againſt vs, to deuoure vs all. The ſinnes of the land, are great, grieuous, and crying ſinnes; the ſinnes of the firſt world, the ſins of <hi>Zo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,</hi> the ſinnes of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> the ſinnes of <hi>Iewes</hi> and <hi>Gextiles,</hi> the ſinnes of <hi>Turkes</hi> and <hi>Pagans;</hi> all theſe are rife amongſt vs; and we ſurpaſſe them in profanenes, in vnthankfulnes, in contemt of the word &amp; of good men, in pride, couetouſnes and cruelty.

The Lord complaineth that <note place="margin">Eſay 56.</note>the watchmen of <hi>Iſrael</hi> are blind, and haue no knowledge: and againe, my people periſh for want of knowledge; Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe thou haſt refuſed knowledge, I will refuſe thee, that <note place="margin">Oſe. 4.</note>thou ſhalt be no Prieſt to me.

Some other Miniſters haue flattered theſe Papiſts openly, and ſecretly; they haue hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den and maintayned points of popery: and is it any mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell, though Papiſts grow and encreaſe? Many great men, magiſtrates, and other officers, haue beene careleſſe in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuting good lawes againſt them, they haue winked at them, countenanced them, kept them company, ſhewed them more fauour and kindnes, then to the good friends of the Goſpel. Many haue matched and maried with them, &amp; hath not all this encouraged and emboldned Papiſts? We haue bin careleſſe and cold in our owne religion, we haue deſpiſed and diſgraced the beſt friends of it: the liues of many profeſſors and preachers hath beene very bad, and is it any maruell if Papiſtes encreaſe and grow? they haue ſeene jarres, contentions, and controuerſies amongſt vs, they haue beene ſuffered to grow in wealth &amp; power, they haue beene ſuffered to bring and breede vp their children this forty and ſeauen yeeres in popery, either by being not baptiſed at all, or elſe being baptiſed by popiſh Prieſtes, who after inſtructed, and confirmed them: ſo that now young men, maides, and children, are become deſperate Papiſts, and reſolute traytors.

The mercy of God, his long ſuffering and patience, doth moue and draw vs to repentance.

                  <p>WE are to make this vſe of this great deliuerance: We are to conceiue a greater hatred of popery, grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter care to ſuppreſſe Papiſts and their religion, ſeeing they bring forth ſuch curſed, and bloudie fruits of treaſon and murder. Indeede wee may learne ſomething, and make ſome profit by theſe rebels, Gods enemies and ours. They joyne their hands, hearts, and purſes together about miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe, they help and relieue thoſe of their owne profeſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on liberally: let vs be as liberall to Gods ſeruants: they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe no paines to draw as many as they can to their falſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion; they are deuout, zealous, and watchful in their prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and idolatrous Maſſe: let vs be as zealous in the true worſhip of God. They ſtand ſtoutly in defence of their owne traditions, let vs be as ſtout in maintayning the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection and ſincerity of Gods word. They are hot and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute for the defence of idolatry and ſuperſtition, and are ready to venture life and liuing for it: let vs be as conſtant in defence of the Goſpell. They doe reuerently eſteeme of their idolatrous Prieſts, of their falſe guides and teachers, and doe liberally maintaine them: let vs be as kinde and liberall to the faithfull miniſters of God. They refuſe no paines, by day nor night, by ſea and land, to bring their wicked purpoſes to paſſe, they ſpare for no coſt, they feare no danger, they refuſe no labour, to further their falſe reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, to worke miſchiefe, and murder: let vs be as carefull, and painefull to further true religion, and to bring good things to paſſe. The children of this world, ſaith our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour <note place="margin">Luc. 16. 8.</note>Chriſt, are wiſer in their generation, then the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of light: this I ſpeake to our ſhame, but yet I doe not juſtifie the Papiſts, nor their religion at all, they are odious and abhominable, and to be vtterly deteſted and ſuppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed of all good and honeſt men, ſo farre as lyeth in their

power. Now to draw vs to the hatred of popery, and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſsing of it, though we haue done it partly before, let vs conſider the blaſphemy, cruelty, and treachery of Papiſts, and their religion. They are groſſe idolaters, they make more gods then one; as the Virgin, the Saints, the Pope, the Croſſe: they aſcribe that to them, which is due to God. They are notorious hypocrites, they ſtand vpon their own righteouſnes, they preferre their owne inuentions, before the commandements of God. They would ſeeme to bee that which they are not, they profeſſe in mouth one God, one Sauiour, but in deede and practiſe, they haue many. They profeſſe holines, conſcience, and charity; and yet their hearts and hands, are ful of impiety and bloud. They are like the Phariſees of whome we ſpake before: of ſuch <note place="margin">Prou 30.</note>a generation ſpeaketh <hi>Salomon,</hi> that are pure in their owne conceit. They are like the falſe Apoſtles in <hi>Corinth,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitfull workers, transforming themſelues into the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles <note place="margin">2. Cor. 11. 13.</note>of Chriſt; and no maruell, for Satan himſelfe is tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed into an Angell of light. They are enemies to Chriſt Ieſus the ſonne of God, they deny the vertue and power of his redemption: they quite ouerthrowe his three offices, being Prieſt, King, and Prophet. They ouerthrowe his kingly office, by the Popes ſupremacie. They ouerthrow his prieſtly office, by their idolatrous Maſſe. They ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwe his propheticall office, by their traditions. They are enemies to the Goſpell of Chriſt, they count it inſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient, a dead letter, a dumb maſter, the blacke Goſpel, dead inke, inkie diuinity, a noſe of waxe, a leaden rule; they count it doubtful and vncertaine. They ſay that it recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth authority from the Church, as though the ſubject were aboue the Prince, the creature aboue the Creator, man aboue God. They make their traditions equall with Gods worde, if not aboue it: their religion as you haue heard, (and ſhall ſee further) is flat againſt the Goſpel. They keepe the Scriptures in a ſtrange tongue, they burne the bleſſed Bible, and the preachers and profeſſors of it. They
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:15371:45"/>
adde and diminiſh, they abaſe, and wreſt the bleſſed word of God at their pleaſures, they are enemies to the true Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike faith. They hold and teach wauering and doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, therefore they are enemies to faith: no Papiſt, as they themſelues confeſſe, can by their faith aſſure themſelues of their ſaluation. A curſed, deſperate, and damned religion, that can not aſſure any that profeſſe the ſame, to be ſaued. It is their owne Cannon in their <hi>Tridentine</hi> Counſell, canon 15. <hi>Si quis dixerit hominem renatum,</hi> &amp;c. that is, If any man ſhall ſay, that a man renewed and borne againe, and juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, is bound by faith to beleeue, that he is certainely of the number of thoſe that are predeſtinated, <hi>anathema ſit,</hi> let him be accurſed. They are enemies to good woorkes, though they thinke to be ſaued by them: they practiſe, defend, and tolerate ſinfull workes, as idolatry, ſorcery, ſlewes, diſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling, perjurie, treaſons, and murthers: they are ennemies to chriſtian Princes, in making themſelues ſlaues to an Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian Prieſt, in holding the Popes ſupremacie, and in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiring againſt lawfull gouernours. They are ennemies to their owne natiue country, and kinred, ſeeking their ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw, and that ſtrangers ſhould rule ouer them: and judge by all this, if they be not moſt enemies to themſelues, their wiues, and children, and moſt of all to their owne ſoules: conſider their wilfulneſſe and obſtinacie, the long time of patience and mercy towardes them. Many of them might haue had conference, ſome haue had it, others refuſe it: how gently haue they beene dealt withall? how long ſuffered, and yet not better, but woorſe? No meanes can preuaile with them, neither mercy, nor threatning, nor conference: they will not hearken to the voyce of the charmer, charme he neuer ſo wiſely: Nothing will reclaime a deſperate and reſolute Papiſt; the duety, loue, and feare of God can not holde a Papiſt from blaſphemy againſt God. The duetie of faith, and alegiance of a Papiſt to his Prince cannot keep him from treaſon to his Prince. The duety of deare loue to his naturall countrey, cannot withdrawe a Papiſt from aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:15371:46"/>
to, nor from procuring, the ſpoyle, deſtruction, and alienation of his countrey. The duety of kinde, and natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall pitty, cannot ſtay a Papiſt from murthering the feeble ſex, nor ſeely tender innocencie, nor reuerent olde age. The duty of familiarity, and youth of friendſhip in grauer yeers, of continuall ſociety during all the life paſt, with heapes of mutuall commodities, cannot pull backe a Papiſt from cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty, in killing his deareſt frends. The duety of honour of children to parents, or loue of parents to children, remoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth not a Papiſt from vnnaturall cruelty. The duety of entire loue and fellowſhip betweene man and wife, holdeth no place in the hearts of Papiſts. No duety of kinred, no eſtimation of learning, or vertue; no good reſpect that moo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth good men to loue and compaſsion once toucheth a ſtubborne Papiſt. And let vs conſider the bloudy cruelty of Papiſts at all times againſt the deare ſeruants of God, the friars in <hi>Spaine</hi> haue planted a holy houſe, reſembling the tortures of <hi>Neroes</hi> garden. Remember that horrible maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſacre at <hi>Paris</hi> in <hi>France</hi> 1572. when they ſaw they could not preuaile againſt the Proteſtants by open force, they began by two crafty meanes to intrappe them: the one by preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding a power to be ſent into the Lowe Countries, whereof the Admirall to be captaine, not that they ſo meant, but ſo to vnderſtand what power he had vnder him, and who they were: the other, by a certaine marriage, ſuborned between the Prince of <hi>Nauarre,</hi> and the Kings ſiſter. The Admirall comming from the counſel table, was ſtricken with a peece, after they ſlew him, cutte off his armes and priuy members, and drawing him three dayes through <hi>Paris,</hi> they dragged him to the place of execution, and there hanged him by the heeles.

<pb n="81" facs="tcp:15371:46"/>
Orleans, Tholous, Roan,</hi> ſo that within one month 30000<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of the religious Proteſtants at the leaſt were ſlaine. O cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ell and bloudy Papiſts! In <hi>Rome</hi> at this time there was great joy, proceſsion, gun-ſhot, ſinging; and in <hi>France,</hi> amongſt the Papiſts, bonefires, and ringing, ſo that as the Wiſe man ſaith, It is a paſtime for the foole to doe wickedly. It is the joy of the Papiſt to ſheede innocent bloud. But to come home to our ſelues, remember their cruelty to the bleſſed Martires, they ſpared none, they cutte off all they could, in few yeeres they made hauocke of the Church; there was no mercy at all with them, but faggot, fire, and ſword. In the time of Queene <hi>Marie,</hi> being about fiue yeeres, there were impriſoned, famiſhed, tormented, put to fire, of men, wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, maidens, and children, almoſt foure hundred: diuers beeing men of grauity and learning, women aboue three ſcore, children aboue fortie. Amongeſt women, ſome great with childe, out of whoſe bellie the childe by fire was expelled aliue, and yet alſo cruelly burned: examples beyond all heathen cruelty, and they haue not only beene cruell to the liuing, but to ſuch as were dead and buried. <hi>Bucer</hi> and <hi>Phagius,</hi> two reuerend learned preachers, becauſe when they were aliue they preached the Goſpell ſoundly, and confuted popiſh errors, they commanded their bodies to be taken out of the graues, and being depriued from ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly orders, deliuered them to the handes of the ſecular power. They take the cheſts wherein the corpſes lay, they bring them to the market place in <hi>Cambridge,</hi> a great poſte ſet in the ground to binde the carcaſes to, a great heap of wood to binde them withall, there they burne cheſts, corpſes, and bookes. O cruell Papiſts! O abhominable and beaſtly acte! ſuch as ſtand by, ſcorned and laughed at their cruelty, and follie, vſing ſuch rigour, weapons, and chaines to the dead. The like cruelty they ſhewed to <hi>Peter Martirs</hi> wife, an honeſt, vertuous, religious, and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable Matrone. She died in <hi>Oxford</hi> in King <hi>Edwards</hi> time, they gotte commiſsion to take her out of the graue, they
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:15371:47"/>
digge her vp, and lay her out of chriſtian buriall, becauſe ſhe was interred nigh to S. <hi>Fredſwikes</hi> reliques, they tooke her vp, and buried her in a dunghill. O cruell Papiſtes, voide of humanity, and cruell to the very dead! Let vs conſider further, the grounds and chiefe poſitions of their religion, maintayned by their greateſt and learnedſt Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uines. They hold the Pope to be Lord of earthly, &amp; hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly Empire; they preferre his ſentence before all other. They hold that he is to be judged of none, though he draw many thouſands to hell. They teach, that he onely hath fulneſſe of all power, <hi>quod ſit lex animata in terra,</hi> that all knowledge is ſhut vp in his breaſt, that he hath power to make lawes, and himſelfe ſubject to none. They hold, that he can change the nature of things, that he can make holy, <note place="margin">Dan 7. 25.</note>and vnholy. Is not this like the beaſt whereof <hi>Daniell</hi> ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth, which ſhall ſpeake wordes againſt the moſt high, &amp; ſhall conſume the Saints of the moſt high, and thinke that he may change times and lawes? They hold, that all the Popes doctrine is true, that the church of <hi>Rome</hi> cannot erre, that it hath ſuperiority ouer all other Churches, that they are to referre their faith to it, and to hang vpon the Popes <note place="margin">Reuel. 13. 5.</note>determinations. Is not this the beaſt ſpoken of in the <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calips,</hi> to whome was giuen a mouth that ſpoke great things, and blaſphemies, and he opened his mouth with blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my againſt God, to blaſpheme his name, and his taberna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, and them that dwell in heauen: and it was giuen to him to make warre againſt the Saints, and to ouercome them: and power was giuen him ouer euery kindred, tongue and nation: therefore all that dwell vpon the earth ſhall wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhippe him, whoſe names are not written in the booke of life of the Lambe. What blaſphemies and fooleries, do the Papiſts, and great Doctors hold, of S. <hi>Francis,</hi> and <hi>Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nick<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> that they were better then <hi>Iohn</hi> the Baptiſt, that they did more miracles then Chriſt, and all the Apoſtles. This they deliuered vnto the Church to be beleeued, vnder the paine of a curſe. They hold our profeſsion hereticall, our
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:15371:47"/>
Sacrament, no Sacrament; our Miniſters, no Miniſters; our Coronations of no force; our King, no King. They teach and hold, that the Pope hath right to both ſwordes, that Emperours and Kings are his vaſſalles: therefore Pope <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander</hi> the third, troade with his feete vpon the necke of the Emperour <hi>Fredericke Barbaroſſa,</hi> his clergie abuſing and ſinging that Scripture, <hi>Thou ſhalt walke vpon the Lyon and Aſpe, the young Lyon and Dragon, ſhalt thou treade vnder feete.</hi> The Papiſts and their Doctors teach and holde, that it is a meritorious deede, to kill chriſtian Kings, that no faith, fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, or oath is to be kept with vs, whome they call here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tikes. They hold, that all Proteſtants are excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that they haue no faith, no religion, no Chriſt, but are meere infidels: that their religion diſſolueth the dutie of ſeruants, ſubjects, wiues and children. They teach and hold, that the doctrine of the Popes ſupremacie is to bee holden, vpon paine of damnation. They deny election, &amp; ſucceſsion of Princes; they detract al obedience from them; they defend violent depoſing of them; they count it law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to take armes againſt them; they intend, deſigne, and practiſe the murdering of them; they commend and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prooue ſuch, and doe canonize them as Martirs: but by their leaue (as one ſaith) they are rather martirers than mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirs; and though the Pope put them in the Kalender of mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirs, he muſt not be offended though the hangman put them in his book, for rebels and traytors. And ſuch as their do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine is, ſuch is their practiſe, as we haue ſeene by long ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience.

Doctor <hi>Sanders,</hi> a firebrand in <hi>Ireland,</hi> writeth in his viſible Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chie, and ſaith, That the ſame Pope 1569<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſent the reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend Prieſt <hi>Nicholas Morton</hi> an Engliſh man, for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing and execution of this Bull, and for the ſame pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe were faculties graunted afterwardes to <hi>Robert Parſons,</hi> and <hi>Edmund Campion</hi> for <hi>England.</hi> The father muſt needes be borne before the childe be gotten. After Pope <hi>Pius</hi> his Bull, came the rebellion in the North; after that, many trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons againſt her Majeſtie, in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland:</hi> by <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders Throgmorton, Stanley, Babington, Arden, Summeruile, Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, Cullen, Squire, Lopus,</hi> and now, a furnace prouided to conſume a kingdome at once: and for this no doubt they <note place="margin">M. Norton.</note>haue direction and authority from the Pope. So that as one ſaith, writing againſt the Northren rebelles, the Popes Bull hath begotten many calues, ſome traiterous calues, as the practiſers and vnderminers of the State, ſome rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and ſeditious calues, ſome daintie calues with white fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, that is, diſſembling hipocrites which watch their time, ſome calues with blacke faces, bleaters, and common ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers at true religion: ſome apoſtaticall calues, that haue forſooken the faith, and doe impugne the knowne trueth.
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:15371:48"/>
Some tame and drowſie calues, that with their brutiſh ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition, cannot raiſe vp their heads from the ground, nor lift vp their eies to heauen, ſome running &amp; gadding calues; for theſe gadde and runne about nine hundred miles, and no maruell: for they deſire not to ſucke milke, but bloud. Some calues with hornes, ſome without; ſome with power running fiercely, ſome puſhing with their vnarmed heads as eluiſhly as they be able: ſome Doctor calues, ſome Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor calues, and ſome of other degrees, ſome whome no fence will hold, no not the broad ſea. All theſe, ſince they receiued their Syres bleſsing, are waxen wilder and mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der then they were, no heard-men can rule them; but as if the gad-flie were in their tailes, they runne whisking about, and with meere eluiſhnes will taſte no wholſome and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall foode.</p>
                  <p>And let no man be offended, that the fooliſh and ſediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Papiſts are compared to calues, for in the Scripture ſot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh people are compared to oxen, and aſſes, horſes, and mules: contemners, perſecuters, and murderers, are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to bulles, and lions, to wolues, and vipers, to dogs, and ſwine. But let vs ſee, how one in a booke entituled <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pa confutatus,</hi> bringeth in Queene <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> anſwering Pope <hi>Pius</hi> his ſeditious Bull in this manner: If I had recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued theſe notes of infamy from any other, but only of thee O Romane Antichriſt, I woulde haue vſed a more exacte ſpeech in defence of my ſelfe; now what is more for my true credit, and euerlaſting glory, then to be perſecuted of thee a chiefe enemie of Chriſt? no man can be his friend, except he be thy enemy, and this is an honour, and credit to me, that thou with <hi>Seba</hi> doeſt perſecute me, with other holy friends of God, the cauſe not being mine, but Chriſts.

                  </p>
                  <p>An other learned man, long ſince, ſpeaketh to the ſame purpoſe: I dare warrant the Prince this (ſaith hee) before God and man, it is both good pollicie, and good diuinity, to puniſh Gods enemies, and his enemies, and yet retaine the name of a milde and mercifull Prince: hee may be juſt and ſeuere, yet mercifull and milde. This was the Decree
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:15371:49"/>
of a King, <hi>Ezra</hi> 7. Whoſoeuer will not doe the law of God, and the Kings law, let him haue judgement without delay, whether it be vnto death, or to baniſhment, or to confiſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of goodes, or to impriſonment. <hi>Dauid</hi> deſtroyed all Gods enemies, and that in the morning of his kingdome, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 101. Thus doing, hee was a man according to Gods heart. Let no Prince looke to haue Gods heart, if hee doe contrary to <hi>Dauid;</hi> and if a Prince looſe Gods heart, he lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth more than mans heart can thinke. It is ſaid of <hi>Moſes,</hi> that hee was the mildeſt of all men that liued on the earth; and yet <hi>Moſes</hi> killed an <hi>Aegiptian</hi> that moleſted his countri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, <hi>Exodus</hi> 2. 12. And when the golden Calfe of idolatry was erected, hee willed them to arme their handes, and to thruſt their ſwordes in the fleſh of their neare kinſmen, and to make hauocke of their liues, and ſo there were killed three thouſand: and <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaide they had made holy their handes vnto God. The mildeſt man that euer was in the world thus behaued himſelfe to Gods enemies. And not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the juſt puniſhment of al theſe idolaters, <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> ſhall euer keepe ſtill his praiſe and be called juſtly, Milde <hi>Moſes, Exodus</hi> 32. <hi>Salomon</hi> that was ſo milde and peaceable whenas an euill hauty hearted ſubject named <hi>Adoniah,</hi> tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row feaſting, and banquetting, and popular behauiour, had ſtrengthned himſelfe with friendſhips, and partly, through kinſmen, and partly, through friends, being drawen into a great ſpirite, to gape for the Crowne, had gotten the kings owne mother to ſpeake for him, to marry the Shunammite, by whom he might make title to the Crowne. Then milde <hi>Salomon</hi> thus anſwered his mother, 1. <hi>Kings</hi> 2. 22. And why dooſt thou aske <hi>Abiſhag</hi> the Shunammite for <hi>Adoniah?</hi> Aske for him the kingdome alſo: for he is mine elder brother, &amp; hath for him both <hi>Abiathar</hi> the Prieſt, and <hi>Ioab</hi> the ſonne of <hi>Zeruiah.</hi> Then king <hi>Salomon</hi> ſware by the Lorde, ſaying, God doe ſo to me, and more alſo, if <hi>Adoniah</hi> hath not ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken this word againſt his owne life; now therefore, as the Lord liueth who hath eſtabliſhed me, and ſet mee vpon the
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:15371:50"/>
throne of <hi>David</hi> my father, who alſo hath made me an houſe, as he promiſed, <hi>Adoniah</hi> ſhall ſurely die this day. And king <hi>Salomon</hi> ſent by the hand of <hi>Benaiah</hi> the ſon of <hi>Iehoiada,</hi> and hee ſmote him that hee died. <hi>Salomon</hi> was wiſe, yet <hi>Salomon</hi> could puniſh. King <hi>Dauid</hi> himſelfe ſaith, That his Song ſhould be of mercy and judgement: So that muſicke ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth vpon two ſtrings, mercy the one, and judgement the other. King <hi>Dauid</hi> touched both the ſtrings, and ſtrooke them both: and therefore in his regiment there was good muſicke. Our Prince hath yet ſtroken but the one ſtring, and played vpon mercy; but if ſhe would now ſtrike vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on both the ſtrings, and let her ſong be of mercy and judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, then there ſhould be a goodly muſike in hir regiment, and all things would be in much better tune than now they are.</p>

                     <hi>Ambroſe</hi> in his booke of <hi>Offices</hi> ſaieth, <hi>Beatus qui tenet manſuetudinem &amp; rigorem,</hi> &amp;c. Bleſſed is hee that keepeth both mildeneſſe and rigorous juſtice, that by the meanes of one, innocency be not oppreſſed, and by the meanes of the other, diſcipline be kept. <hi>Gregory</hi> in his <hi>Moralls</hi> ſaieth, Let rigor ſo rule mildeneſſe, and mildeneſſe ſo beautifie ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gor: Let the one ſo take the commendation from the other, that neither rigor be too rigorous, nor mildenes too looſe. Correct a wiſe man with a nodde, and a foole with a club. If theſe Northerne rebells had bin of any ſober wit, by this time ſo many noddes would haue ſtaied them; but it is well inough conſidered, I thinke, of thoſe which haue moſt cauſe to conſider it, that nodding will not ſerue, nor becking wil not ſerue, and checking will not ſerue: therefore it muſt be a clubbe, or it muſt be a hatchet, or it muſt be a halter, or ſomething it muſt be; or elſe of a ſurety ſome of their heads will neuer be quiet. As it is true, that two and two maketh foure; that when the Sunne is in the middeſt of heauen, it is noone time; that euery part of the circle differeth equally from the centre; that when the Sunne ariſeth, it is morning; ſo is it infallibly true, that no perfect Papiſt can be to any
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:15371:50"/>
Chriſtian Prince, a good ſubject. And this I proue by theſe reaſons: Euery one that is a good ſubject; muſt be vpon a right conſcience a good ſubject: but Papiſts haue corrupt conſciences, ſeared with a hot iron; therefore they cannot be good ſubjects. Againe, whoſoeuer will be a ſubject for conſcience ſake, as all true ſubjects muſt be, that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience muſt be informed by the word of God: the Papiſts are not informed by Gods worde, but falſely informed: therefore they cannot be true ſubjects. Thirdly, he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be a true ſubject, that can looſe himſelfe from his dutie to his Prince when he liſteth, but the Pope at al times when he liſt, will diſpenſe with his, and diſcharge them from all duties to all men: therefore, the Papiſts are no good ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, but by the Popes permiſsion are ſubjects, or not ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, and play at vnder or ouer with the Prince as they liſt. Fourthly, no man can ſerue two maſters, the Pope is one maſter, the Prince another: for their lawes bee in diuers points quite contrary. Therefore he that will be a perfect Papiſt, muſt needes be a halting ſubject to our Prince. Fift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, they hold this for infallible, and inflexible, that <hi>Fides non eſt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>eruanda cum haeretiois:</hi> but our Prince is a goſpeler Prince, which they call an heretike: therefore they meane infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly not to keepe any troth with their Prince. Sixtly, both they and we hold this, that none ought to keepe company with any excommunicated perſon: but our Prince is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicate, as they ſay, by the Pope, and they thinke in conſcience, the Pope cannot erre: therfore their conſcience while they are Papiſts, will not let them thinke the Prince worthy of their company: then they will not be ſubjects as they ought to be. The worſe traytors to God, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belles to the Prince are theſe Papiſts; vpon them therefore firſt and principally let the ſword be drawne, &amp; ſith they be ſo great fooles, and will neuer learne their dutie, let them in Gods name feele the puniſhment of a club, a hat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chet, or a halter: and in ſo dooing I dare ſay, God will be highly pleaſed.</p>

                  <p>BVT they will ſay, the Church was not perfect in the Apoſtles times, and they had not power then to ſet themſelues againſt Princes: Was not the Church perfect in the Apoſtles times, when Chriſt the head was with them, and fully, and perfectly inſtructed the Apoſtles in al things, haue they of late time ſome new reuelations from heauen, <note place="margin">Iohn 15. 15</note>haue they any better, more full, or perfect doctrine then the Goſpell? did not the Apoſtles receiue it from Chriſt himſelfe, who taught all things needefull and neceſſary to ſaluation? I haue ſaith he, called you friends for all things that I haue heard from my father, I haue made knowne to you. Chriſt giueth no further commiſsion to the Apoſtles, <note place="margin">Matth. 28.</note>and their ſucceſſors, but this, that they ſhould teach all na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to obſerue euery thing which he commanded them. The Apoſtles had the ſpirit of truth, the holy Ghoſt which called al things to their remembrance which Chriſt taught them. To the receiuing of this doctrine, Chriſt hath ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded <note place="margin">Marke 16.</note>the promiſe of ſaluation: hee that beleeueth this ſhall be ſaued: and theſe things were written that we might be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue, <note place="margin">Iohn 20.</note>and in beleeuing might haue life. Chriſt offereth prayers to his father for thoſe that beleeue this doctrine: I <note place="margin">Iohn 17. 20.</note>pray not for theſe alone, meaning the Apoſtles, but I pray, ſaith he, for them alſo which ſhall beleeue in mee through their word. Curſed therefore Prince, Pope, or Prelate; nay curſed Angell which teach another Goſpell. Your traditions you fooliſh Papiſts are abhominable, and no part of Gods word. Chriſt taught that which hee heard from his father; the Diſciples taught that which they had from Chriſt: true miniſters teach that which they learne from the Apoſtles. Theſe be true traditions, from the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to the Sonne, from the Sonne to the Apoſtles, from the Apoſtles to vs. All other which haue not this originall,

are counterfeit and curſed. The Goſpell is the Teſtament and laſt will of Chriſt, nothing to bee added to any mans to any mans will, though neuer ſo poore, nothing to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from it. Kings will not ſuffer any men of their pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate authority to counterfeit, or clippe his coine, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face his picture, his armes, or ſeale: to make the common waites, ballances, or meaſures, greater or leſſe: and will God ſuffer the like injurie and diſhonor to be done againſt his ſacred word? mens traditions are vncertaine, and injuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to the word and ſpirit of Chriſt, they make men hipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites, and not ſound chriſtians, they are the cauſes of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution, diſcord, of trouble, and torment of conſcience, ſome of the fathers curſe ſuch traditions as are not warran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from the legall or euangelicall Scripture, ſome account them ſinfull traditions, which are obtruded without any warrant from Gods word, and we may eaſilie ſee, that the cauſe of al errors in popery, of murders and treaſons, is this, becauſe they reſt not wholly and only vpon the perfection of the Scripture, but vpon Counſels, traditions, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>written verities.</p>

                  <p>ANd though princes be neuer ſo wicked, yet we are not to breake our oath &amp; promiſe of faith and allegeance to them. And therefore curſed is your Pope, which doeth take vpon him to free you from all ſuch oathes, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes; and ſo you become truce-breakers, perfidious, and perjured perſons. <hi>Sigisbertus</hi> ſaith, that it is a pernitious hereſie, to beleeue that the Pope can diſcharge ſubjects from their oath and bond of allegiance. The very Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans and Infidels haue made a conſcience of an oath and promiſe. The men of Iſrael ſpared the <hi>Gibeonites</hi> who had <note place="margin">Ioſ. 9.</note>deceiued them, yet becauſe they had ſworne to them, by the Lord God of Iſrael, they would not touch them. We haue heard of <hi>Zedekiah,</hi> who was grieuouſly puniſhed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he brake his promiſe and fidelity, though it was to a wicked King: and ſee what the Prophet <hi>Ezechiel</hi> ſaith: Behold, the King of <hi>Babel</hi> is come to <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> and hath taken <hi>Iechonia</hi> the King thereof, and the Princes thereof, &amp; ledde them with him to <hi>Babel,</hi> and hath taken one of the Kings ſeede, and made a couenant with him, but he rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led againſt him. Shall he proſper ſaith the Lord? ſhall he eſcape that doth ſuch things? or ſhall he breake the coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
<pb facs="tcp:15371:55"/>
and be deliuered? he hath deſpiſed the oath, and bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken the couenant: therefore thus ſaith the Lord God, as I liue, I will ſurely bring my oath that he hath deſpiſed, and my couenant that he hath broken vpon his owne head, and I will ſpread my nette vpon him, and he ſhalbe taken in my <note place="margin">Ezech. 17.</note>nette, and I will bring him to <hi>Babel,</hi> and will enter into judgement with him there, for the treſpaſſe that hee hath committed againſt me. And for the full concluſion, and determination of this point, I will reſt vpon the Canon, and ſentence of that <hi>Toletane</hi> Councell 4. Canon 7. There is ſuch treacherie and vntruth amongſt many nations, as it is reported, that they contemne an oath made to their Kings, and by their mouth they diſſemble the profeſsion of an oath, when in their minde they ſhould hold the impiety of falſehood. They ſweare to their Kings, and yet breake their faith which they haue promiſed. They feare not that booke full of curſes againſt thoſe which ſweare falſely: what hope of ſuch people fighting againſt their enemies? what truſt is to be had to them? what couenant will they not breake? how ſhall they keepe their oathes to their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, ſeeing they doe not keep it to their owne Kings? who is ſo mad, that would cut off his owne head with his owne hand? They, as it is known, being forgetfull of their owne ſaluation, doe kill themſelues with their owne hand, by turning their force againſt themſelues and their own Kings. And whereas the Lord ſaith, touch not mine annoynted: &amp; <hi>Dauid</hi> ſaith, who can lay hands vpon the Lords annoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and be innocent? theſe feare nothing at all to committe perjurie, and to kill Kings. Leagues and promiſes that are made to the enemies, are to be kept, and not to bee bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken. If faith be to be kept in warre, much more in other things. It is ſacriledge to breake promiſe, which people haue made to their Kings, becauſe they do offend, not only againſt them, but againſt God, in whoſe name they take their oath. And after in the ſame Councell and Canon, if we wil auoide the anger of God, &amp; deſire his mercy, let vs
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:15371:55"/>
religiouſſie worſhip and feare God, let vs keepe our promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes made vnto our Kings: let there not be in vs as in other nations, falſehood, ſubtiltie, perjurie, and heapes of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracies. Let none among vs take the kingdome by pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption, let none ſtirre vp ſeditions, let none purpoſe nor deuiſe the death of Kings. If this admonition cannot cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect our mindes, nor draw our hearts to common ſafetie, then harken to this ſentence: Whoſoeuer of vs by any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracie or deuiſe, ſhall breake the bond of an oath for the ſtate of his countrie, for the preſeruation of the Kings ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; or ſhall kill the King, or put him from his kingdome; or by tyrannical preſumption ſhall vſurpe the royall ſeat, <hi>ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thema ſit,</hi> let him be accurſed in the ſight of God the father his Angels, &amp; let him be cut off from the catholike church, which he hath prophaned by his perjurie: and from the company of all chriſtians, with all the companions of his impiety, and let him be condemned with the Diuel, and his Angels in euerlaſting torments. This ſentence was the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond and third time denounced, and the conſent of all that were preſent required to it, and it was anſwered by all the people; He that ſhall preſume againſt this Canon, <hi>anathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma, maranatha,</hi> that is, let deſtruction be vpon him in the comming of the Lord Ieſus, and let him, and his fellowes haue their part with <hi>Iudas Iſcariot,</hi> Amen.

                  <p>Let vs conſider but ſome more fewe examples, Doctor <hi>Sanders,</hi> a naturall borne ſubiect, but an vnnaturall rebell, beeing the Popes Iriſh Legate, and had power from the Pope to take Armes, and moue warres in <hi>Ireland;</hi> but what was his ende? he wandered in the mountaines without ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour, died rauingly in a frenzie.

                  <p>Another of ſingular note was <hi>Iohn</hi> of <hi>Deſmont,</hi> brother to the Earle, a very bloody faithleſſe traitor, a notable mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therer of his familiar friends, wandering to ſeeke ſome prey as a Woolfe in the woodes, was taken and beheaded after his own vſage, being as he thought ſufficiently armed with Popes Buls, and certaine <hi>Agnus Dei,</hi> and one notable ring a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout his necke, ſent from the Popes finger, as it was ſaid; but theſe he ſaw ſaued not his life, and ſure God the defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of his annointed, and an enemie to traitors, hath alwaies brought, and will bring the like to miſerable ende.

Againe the Pope ſaith, the ſpirituall ſword is exerciſed by the Church; the temporall, for the Church; the former by the hand of the Prieſt, the latter by the hands of Kings and Souldiers, but at the becke and ſufferance of the Prieſt. Chriſt liberall, mercifull, pittifull to all, no tyrant, no op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſor; the Popes moſt greedie and couetous oppreſſors, extortioners, and robbers. <hi>Theodore Nihemius tract.</hi> 6. 37. complaineth of the oppreſsion of <hi>Rome,</hi> on this manner: The Popes treaſure-houſe, ſaith hee, is like the ſea, into which all riuers runne, and yet it doth not ouerflow: for ſo into this, are carried out of diuers parts of the world, thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand weights of gold, and yet it is not filled; wherein there is a generation which changeth ſwordes for teeth, that it may eate vp the needie vpon earth, and the poore from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong men: wherein there be many blood-ſuckers, which ſay, Bring, Bring: the officers of ſuch treaſurie are called <hi>Gentes camere,</hi> and that truely, for Gentiles bee barbarous nations, which haue manners diſcrepant from manners of men; right Gentiles, which ſhall haue their lot with infernal furies, or harepies; and with <hi>Tantalus,</hi> being athirſt and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer ſatisfied.

Some of their Popes were void of all reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and very Atheiſts. Pope <hi>Leo</hi> the tenth, when Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall <hi>Bembus</hi> was communing with him of certaine Euange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licall hiſtories, he made this godles anſwere, <hi>Quantum nobis &amp; noſtro cetui profuerit ea de Chriſto fabula, ſatis eſt omnibus ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culis notum:</hi> How much that fable of Chriſt hath profited vs and our company, it is knowne well enough to all ages. Another Pope confeſſed at his death, that he alwaies doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted whether there was a God, that hee doubted of the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortalitie of the ſoule, and of the laſt iudgement. <hi>Rome</hi> it ſelfe, accounted by the Papiſts, the Popes chaire, and the Catholike Church, is indeede the ſhop of all wickedneſſe, whoriſh <hi>Babylon,</hi> filthy <hi>Sodome,</hi> the ſchoole of Errors, &amp; a ſhameleſſe ſtrumpet.</p>

                  <p>It remaineth, that the man of ſinne be reuealed, the ſonne of perdition, a diuell, not onely of the day, but alſo of noone day; which is not only transfigured into an Angel of light, but is exalted aboue all that is called God, or is worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped.

Laſt of all, you may ſee here what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer is confuſed, whatſoeuer is blacke, whatſoeuer is any way horrible, or is fained ſo to be.</p>
                  <p>To be briefe, heere is a ſinke of all ſinfull and wicked things. This is, O fooliſh Papiſts! your mother and catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like church: theſe are your holy fathers, and as you count them, Chriſts Vicars, &amp; ſucceſſors of the Apoſtles, which cannot erre. But you will ſay, theſe are perſonall abuſes, &amp; though ſome of your Popes haue beene bad<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yet others haue beene good: let it be ſo, yet ſuch wicked ones are not fit to curſe, judge, and condemne others, and this may ſtop your mouthes, which are open againſt the bad liues of prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers and profeſſors; ſeeing there can be none worſe then your ſelues are. But the beſt of your Popes cannot cleere themſelues of pride, couetouſnes, ambition, and diuers o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther crimes, they cannot purge themſelues of here ſie, ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrie, hipocriſie, perjurie, treaſons, rebellions, murthers: which both you and they doe profeſſe, and practiſe: and therefore they are not the ſucceſſors of Chriſt, they ſit not in <hi>Peters</hi> chaire, they are not like Chriſt at al, but quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, &amp; oppoſite to his doctrine &amp; example: but are rather like, and very like to the Diuell himſelfe. He is ſaid to be the accuſer of the brethren, the Pope is a ſhameleſſe accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer of chriſtian Kings and Churches. The Diuell is Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than, that is, an aduerſary to mans ſaluation: the Pope by all meanes poſsible, ſheweth himſelfe an vtter enemy to all meanes of grace and life. The Diuell is ſaid to be a temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, becauſe he doth ſolicite, and draw all men to euill as much as he can. The Pope by ſea and land ſeeketh by all meanes to draw whome he can to his curſed religion. The Diuell is called the olde ſerpent, becauſe he is ſubtill and deceitfull. The Pope profeſſeth, and practiſeth all kinde of ſubtilty, deceit, and crafty dealing. The Diuell is a ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar, and father of lies: the Pope teacheth and commandeth
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:15371:59"/>
notorious lies, legendes, and fables. The Diuell is a mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derer, a lyon, that cruell and red dragon: the Pope as wee haue heard, approoueth, &amp; commandeth horrible murders.</p>
                  <p>A learned man long ſince, hath more fully compared the Pope and the Diuell together. Firſt, the Diuell, ſaith he, is called Satan, that is, a hinderer: the Pope is Chriſts greateſt hinderer, and chiefeſt hurter. 2. The Diuell is called <gap reason="foreign">

It is ſaid of the Diuell, Satan fell like lightning from heauen: it is ſaid of the Pope and his, <hi>Vidi ſtellas cadentes à coelo:</hi> I ſaw ſtarres fall from heauen. 5. The Diuell was a lyar from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning: It is ſaid of the Pope, that he ſpake great things, that is, lies, and blaſphemies. 6. The Diuell did not ſtand in the truth, no more did the Pope: according to that ſaying, this day is poyſon entered into the Church. 7. The Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell is a roaring Lyon, ſo is the Pope, ſo his Spaniſh inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitors. 8. The Diuell is that ſerpent which perſecuteth the woman in the earth; the Church in this earth hath no ſuch perſecuting ſerpent, as that ſerpentine perſecutor of <hi>Rome.</hi> 9. <hi>Paul</hi> when he enuieth againſt <hi>Elymas</hi> the ſorcerer, and calles him the Diuels ſonne, Acts 13. he ſeemeth to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound this word: the Diuelles ſonne in this deſcription, a man full of all manner of deceit, an enemie of all righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, and one that ceaſeth not to peruert the right waies of God. This toucheth the Pope of <hi>Rome</hi> moſt neerely in euery point. If this be the definition of the Diuels ſonne, he is vndoubtedly the Diuels owne deare ſonne. 10. The Diuell promiſed Chriſt all the wealth in the world, if hee would fall downe and worſhip him: the Pope promiſeth Kingdomes, Earledomes, Lordſhips, Biſhoprickes, Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bies, &amp;c. 11. The Diuell is called a Whale, becauſe hee ruleth in the tumultuous waues of the ſea: the Pope is a
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:15371:60"/>
whale, becauſe he beareth ſwinge in the vaine waues of this buſie world. 12. The Diuell is called a Dragon, becauſe he deuoureth ſoules: the Pope is a Dragon, becauſe he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoureth both bodies, and ſoules. 13. The Dragon drew the third part of the ſtarres out of heauen: the Pope with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew, by liuings, and giuings, the third part of the beſt lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned men in Chriſtendome from the true doctrine: ſo that I ſay againe, the Pope is a foule head, becauſe the Diuell is a foule head. And this woman, or Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> is as foule as the Deuill: becauſe her head the Pope is as foule as the Diuell.</p>

And marke, I pray you, how many arguments might be gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for the neceſsitie of preaching, from that one chapter, beeing the 10. of S. <hi>Luke</hi> his Goſpel; there Chriſt Ieſus the Sauiour of the world, in pittie and compaſsion of mens ſoules, ſendeth forth at one time, 70 preachers, he comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth to pray to the Lord of the harueſt, to ſend forth more ſuch labourers into his harueſt, hee complaineth that the number of ſuch are fewe: hee confirmeth their miniſtry, by threatning judgements againſt ſuch as contemne their do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine: he taketh ſuch contempt to be againſt himſelfe. And when the Diſciples returned, and told him of the good ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe and effects of their preaching, hee ſaid vnto them, I ſaw Sathan like lightening fall downe from heauen. The meaning is, that the diuell hath, as it were, a kingdome in the hearts of men, through ignorance, errors, and ſinne; but this power of Sathan is beaten downe by the preaching of <note place="margin">Act. 26.</note>the Goſpell. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaking of the power of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry ſaith, That it openeth the eies, that it turneth from darkeneſſe to light, and from the power of Sathan to God. After the plentifull preaching of the word, it followeth, It <note place="margin">Apoc. 14.</note>is fallen, It is fallen, <hi>Babylon</hi> the great citie, the kingdome of ſinne, of Sathan, and of Antichriſt, is ouerthrown by the preaching of the Goſpel.
